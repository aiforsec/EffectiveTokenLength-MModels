This image depicts an urban street scene with a prominent "Road Closed" sign in the foreground. The sign is white with a red circle and horizontal line symbolizing no entry. Behind the sign, a series of orange traffic cones are lined along the center of the road, reinforcing the road closure. A temporary mesh fence runs parallel to the street on the right, partially obscuring the sidewalk. The street is flanked by modern buildings with reflective glass facades under a clear blue sky. In the distance, pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalk, and there are various metal utility covers on the asphalt.
