The image shows an overcast day on an urban street with a row of shops to the left. A green traffic light is prominently displayed in the foreground. Shop fronts appear closed with metal shutters, one of which is tagged with graffiti. Fresh produce is set outside on the sidewalk. The street slopes downhill with residential buildings on the right. A distant cityscape with indistinct buildings fades into the misty background. Various cars are parked along the street. Urban infrastructure, such as lamp posts and traffic signs, line the sidewalk. The weather gives a hazy atmosphere to the scene.
