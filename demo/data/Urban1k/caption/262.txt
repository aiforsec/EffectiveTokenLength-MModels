The street is divided, with multiple lanes of vehicular traffic, including a variety of cars and some taxis identifiable by their distinct colors and roof signage. Pedestrian crosswalks are visible, with people crossing in an orderly fashion. Traffic signals hang overhead, and one appears red, suggesting traffic is stopped to allow pedestrians to cross. Sidewalks on both sides of the street are busy with pedestrians, and some shops have visible awnings or street-facing displays.
