This image features a red public transport bus on a street, moving toward the viewer with the driver visible through the windshield. The bus number is visible on its front display. It is a single-decker bus with a distinctive boxy design, typical of many urban buses designed for maneuverability in city streets. The side of the bus presents a route number and a fleet number just beneath the driver's side window. Parked cars line the side of the road, which suggests the photo was taken in a residential area. The setting is illuminated by the soft, warm light of a setting or rising sun, casting soft shadows and giving the scene a quiet, early morning or late afternoon atmosphere.
