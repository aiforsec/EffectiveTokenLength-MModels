The image shows the front facade of The Royal London Hospital, an imposing building with a brick and stone exterior. The architecture features a classical style with tall windows, prominent pilasters, and a gabled roofline with a large clock at the center. Below the gabled roof, the building's name is inscribed in large golden letters. The entrance consists of a row of round arches leading to double doors, accessible by a flight of steps. In front of the building, there is a row of blue public-use bicycles parked in docking stations. The street in front is busy with passing vehicles, including a blurry image of a cyclist in motion, and a pedestrian on the sidewalk. Skyscrapers partly visible in the background contrast with the hospital's historical architecture.
