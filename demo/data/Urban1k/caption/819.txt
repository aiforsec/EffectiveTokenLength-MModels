The image depicts an urban street scene, possibly in China, with a white car featuring blue and orange stripes and Chinese characters on the side, in motion, blurring the wheels and bottom. Behind the silvery fence with spiked tops, there's a building with signage indicating it is the "Agricultural Bank of China." Scaffolding is visible beneath the signage. To the right, a person in an orange top is captured in a walking stance, partially obscured by a plant with reddish leaves sitting outside a shop. A utility box and electrical wires are present above the person.
