This is a street scene featuring two buses in a bustling urban area. The foremost bus is predominantly cream with red and black stripes and displays "Brighton & Hove" branding. Its destination sign reads "MEADOWVIEW" and it bears the fleet number 69 and a registration plate that starts with "M69." In the background, there's a double-decker bus also marked with "Brighton & Hove" and a destination sign of "Bathrooms.com." Both buses exhibit a European style of design. Lining the street is a row of commercial buildings, one prominently displaying a "SHOE EXPRESS" storefront with large red lettering. The setting appears to be overcast and there are pedestrians on the sidewalk, including one person directly in front of the SHOE EXPRESS store.
