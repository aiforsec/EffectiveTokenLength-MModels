This is a sunny daytime scene of an urban street corner. In the foreground stands a cluster of objects, including an off-white traffic signal post with overhead signals, a blank white signboard attached on top of a pole, and a red fire hydrant. To the right, dual white obelisk-like structures with blue bands at the top frame a clear blue sky, their bases surrounded by protective barriers. The central area of the image shows a street where cars are parked and a road that leads into the distance with more vehicles and buildings lining its sides. Snow-capped mountain peaks can barely be seen peeking from behind the urban landscape. The architecture suggests a mix of commercial buildings with varied facades in brick and reflective glass. Electrical or trolley wires crisscross over the street.
