The image depicts an urban street scene with a two-story blue and yellow public bus prominently in the foreground. The bus is labeled with the number 28 and a destination indicator. A small queue of passengers, including a person in a wheelchair, waits to board. Behind the bus, several cars are visible, with one in particular, a gray hatchback, closest to the bus. In the background, a yellow bus with the number 22 is stationary at what appears to be a bus stop. Pedestrians are noticeable further back on the sidewalk. The skies are partly cloudy, suggesting a typical day in a town setting.
