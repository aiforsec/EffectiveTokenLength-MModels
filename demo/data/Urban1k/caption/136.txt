The image captures a city street scene under hazy sunlight with the skyline in the background, featuring multiple high-rise buildings shrouded in a light mist. In the foreground, a row of orange traffic cones delineates a construction or work zone where two workers in neon vests are present. To the right, there is a brick building with a signage reading "South Side Control Supply Co." A white delivery truck adorned with imagery and text is parked on the street, in front of which stands a light pole. Several cars are visible, including a parked car in the bottom right corner and others on the street. The atmosphere suggests early morning activity in an urban setting.
