A person appears to be walking a small, dark-colored dog on a sidewalk in an urban setting. The person is wearing dark pants and a navy blue jacket with a hood. The dog is on a red leash. In the foreground, there are out-of-focus white flowers, likely from a tree or shrub. A black, vertical slat fence lines the sidewalk, behind which there's a grassy area and some leafless, budding shrubs. The background shows city buildings, parked cars, and a street fading into the distance under a clear, blue sky. The overall atmosphere suggests a sunny, possibly spring day.
