This image captures a construction zone on a road during daylight. In the foreground, a heavy construction truck with visible signs of wear and dirt is parked. Behind it, partially constructed, tall concrete pillars rise to support an unfinished overpass with exposed metal reinforcements and platforms for workers, hinting at a large infrastructure project. Temporary metal barrier fences line the road, separating the site from active lanes, and a red construction crane towers in the distance against a partly cloudy sky. Various signs indicate the presence of construction-related businesses, and powerlines are visible above the scene. The surroundings are indicative of a suburban or outer urban environment.
