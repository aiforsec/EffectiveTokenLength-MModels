This image captures a sunny urban scene featuring a street corner with a prominent red brick building bearing the "Cambridge Trust Company" signage. A clock is attached to the building's corner near the entrance. Lush green trees fill the background, partially obscuring another brick building with a tall clock tower. The sky is clear and blue. A few individuals are visible: one cycling across the street and two wearing pink shirts, standing near the building. Road signs, including a "Do Not Enter" and a "No Left Turn," are mounted on posts. A black and white police vehicle is parked on the street.
