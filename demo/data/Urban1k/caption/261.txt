You're looking at an urban street scene in bright daylight with a large, two-story building featuring arched doorways and windows, and a flat roofline with a centered flagpole flying a red flag. The building’s façade is white with contrasting darker sections around the ground-level arches. In the foreground, a blue, compact car is prominent on an asphalt road. A man in a white shirt and dark trousers walks on a wide sidewalk, and other people are scattered around. There are palm trees to the right, and an ornate street lamp hangs overhead. The architecture and palm trees suggest a location with Mediterranean or North African influences.
