This image shows a silver and blue city bus with the number "1207" and marked with the route "250 HORSESHOE" on its front electronic signage. There is a bike rack attached to the front of the bus. The vehicle is on a city street lined with tall buildings, including one labeled "SCOTIA TOWER." There is a taxi visible in the background, and it appears to be an overcast day. The bus has a sleek design with dark tinted windows, and multiple passengers are visible inside. It is likely a modern, low-floor transit bus designed for urban public transportation. There are no distinguishing natural features; the setting is completely urban.
