This image captures a sunny day on a city street with clear blue skies. On the left, the sidewalk is lined by a red-brick building with ornate columns and street lamps. There's a USPS mailbox and a trash bin, and a person is walking on the sidewalk. In the center, the road is occupied by several vehicles, with a mix of cars and a single dark-colored truck. Traffic signals show green lights for both directions. On the right, a beige stone building with arched windows is visible, and in the distance, there are other urban structures including flags hanging from a building. The street has a slight curve to the right, with the pedestrian path marked by a brick-edged winding pattern.
