At the center, a yellow city bus with the destination "Borny" displayed on its front approaches amidst the historical buildings lining the street. One building at the left features distinctive arches on its ground level. The architecture suggests an old-town environment. Street-side cafes with sun umbrellas are visible on the left, indicating a vibrant, social atmosphere. The weather appears to be sunny and clear, casting shadows on the pavement.
