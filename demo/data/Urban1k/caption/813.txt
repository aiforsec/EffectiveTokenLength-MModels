The image captures a busy street scene with a red double-decker trolleybus, marked with the number 662, dominating the foreground. The trolleybus is connected to overhead electrical wires. Several cars, including a yellow one, are on the road alongside the bus. The architecture consists of mid-twentieth-century multistory buildings, heavily shadowed by the bright sunlight. Pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalks, and there's a traffic light visible at the corner. The blue sky suggests it's a clear day. Reflections are noticeable on the glass panels of the corner building, and various signs adorn the facades, indicating a bustling urban environment.
