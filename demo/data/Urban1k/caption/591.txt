A rider on a white horse is passing a red city bus on a street. The horse has a dark mane, and the rider wears a purple helmet, a light-colored top, and dark pants. The bus has the word "abellio" on its side, indicating the transport company. There's a glimpse of the bus's interior showing seated passengers. Both the horse and the bus are moving in the same direction. In the background, there are buildings with visible windows, and one has a window box with plants. The street appears to be paved, and there are white road markings.
