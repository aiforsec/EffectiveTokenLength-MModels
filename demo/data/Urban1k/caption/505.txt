A single-decker public transport bus is parked at a curb on an urban street, featuring a blue and cream livery with the name "AVON" across the front. The vehicle's registration plate is visible, and it bears the number 341 on its top front. To the right of the bus, there's a bus stop with a blue sign indicating its purpose. Behind the bus, a building with a green fa√ßade that appears to be a commercial space shares the scene, noticeable with its distinct green-colored branding and entrance. A tower with a clock is just visible in the background, suggesting a town setting. There's a partially obscured red car parked behind the bus, and a pedestrian signal pole stands in the foreground to the right.
