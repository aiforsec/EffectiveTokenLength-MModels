This image captures two buses on a tree-lined street. The foreground shows a red and white bus with the logo "Veolia" displayed prominently on its side; the make "Karosa" is also visible above the windshield. The license plate is visible, starting with "CRZ." Behind it is a second bus, primarily white with green and yellow accents. Both buses have reflective side mirrors and multiple windows. There appears to be a driver inside the foremost bus. Parked cars line one side of the street, and a beige building with multiple windows can be seen in the background. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting it may be a temperate day.
