This image depicts a double-decker bus prominently featuring advertising for Coca-Cola Vanilla with the tagline "it's back!" on its side. The bus, operating under Stagecoach in Manchester, is painted in a corporate livery of red, blue, and orange with white highlights. The route sign on the front and side reads "X50" indicating its service. Partially visible are red brick buildings behind and a car parked in front of the bus. There's a blue car passing by and a pedestrian crossing signal by the roadside. The weather appears overcast, and the overall setting suggests an urban street in the UK.
