The image displays an urban street scene with a black bomb squad vehicle prominently in the foreground. Marked with "BOMB SQUAD" and "EMERGENCY 911" text, as well as the letters "SFPD" within a shield emblem, the vehicle commands attention. Yellow and blue chevron striping is visible on the rear with a series of red and white lights above the rear bumper. On the street, a dark gray SUV follows behind while pedestrians are noticeable on the sidewalks. Billboards and storefronts are part of the backdrop in this sunny, clear day setting. Visible are parts of palm trees and a red Stella Artois sign.
