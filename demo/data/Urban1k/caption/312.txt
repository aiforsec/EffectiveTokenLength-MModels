A navy blue station wagon is parked on a wet parking lot, reflecting a rainy day atmosphere. The car is equipped with a roof rack on which a single surfboard is mounted, positioned lengthwise across the top of the vehicle. The setting includes a muted background with a commercial building housing a "Quiznos Sub" sandwich shop. It features a gray roof and a green awning with a lighter green facade. The parking lot appears to be nearly empty, emphasizing the dreary weather. The raindrops are visible on the ground and on the car, further indicating the recent or ongoing precipitation.
