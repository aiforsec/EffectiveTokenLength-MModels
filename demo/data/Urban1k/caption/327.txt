The image shows a double-decker bus painted in two shades of green with the lower half darker than the upper. The bus is branded 'Southdown' on its side. It is parked beside a metal barrier, and a group of people in high-visibility jackets are standing by the barrier, facing the bus. A cyclist in black attire is passing in front of the bus. More individuals are seen walking along the pavement in the background. The scene seems to be a public, outdoor space, possibly in the UK, and the weather appears clear. The upper deck of the bus has passengers, suggesting the bus is in service.
