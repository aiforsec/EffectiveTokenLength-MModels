A yellow fire hydrant stands near a curb on a sidewalk that has a section painted red, indicating no parking. Next to the hydrant, a large metal anchor with flukes rests on the ground, its chain partially visible. The street curves to the right, lined with parked cars and palm trees, hinting at a coastal location. Buildings rise in the background under a clear blue sky. A drain cover is embedded in the concrete at the sidewalk's edge, where the concrete meets an asphalt road with visible traffic lines. The scene conveys an odd juxtaposition of a maritime object in an urban setting.
