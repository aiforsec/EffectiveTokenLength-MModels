The image shows three coaches parked on an asphalt lot under a partly cloudy sky. On the left, there is a beige coach with dark-tinted windows and the label "MID DEVON COACHES" on the side. Its design is simplistic with a no-frills appearance. In the center, a blue and white coach features a large front display indicating "Sorry... Out of Service." The design appears relatively modern and streamlined. On the right, a cream-colored coach with blue and grey accents appears newer and sports a more aerodynamic design compared to the others. In the background, a multi-story building and a structure resembling a parking garage can be observed.
