A maroon and yellow diesel locomotive with the number 66141 prominently displayed on its front side is about to depart from a station platform. The engine pulls a long train of gray freight wagons stretching into the distance. The platform shows signage, including a "Do Not Cross" line, an "Exit" arrow pointing to the left, and various warning signs. Also visible are overhead pedestrian bridges allowing transit between platforms, against a partly cloudy sky. On the right, there's a glimpse of a commuter, capturing a sense of daily life at the station. The signals above the train present red, indicating a stop.
