A double-decker bus painted in white with purple and magenta accents moves along a city street under clear skies. On the front of the bus, a destination sign displays "Manchester 163 Piccadilly", indicating its route and terminus. The registration plate at the bottom of the bus is visible, reading "MX58 DXL". Reflections of surrounding buildings appear in the bus's windscreen, and the upper deck's front-facing windows. A 'no entry' traffic sign is visible at the top right corner of the photo. In the background, there are other vehicles on the road, pedestrians on the sidewalk, and modern buildings with glass facades.
