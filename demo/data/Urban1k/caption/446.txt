The image shows a double-decker bus parked on the side of a road. The bus has a white base color with red, yellow, and orange stripes along its lower side, and 'BerlinLinienBus' written on the side. In the background, there are cloudy skies above, a few buildings, and a construction crane. A cyclist is visible on the left side, riding on the road, and there's a black car behind the bus. In the foreground, there's a pedestrian crossing sign and metal bollards along the pavement. The overall scene looks like a typical urban street view in a European city during the day.
