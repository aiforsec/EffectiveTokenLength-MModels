This is an image of a white driving school bus (labelled 'AUTO-ECOLE') parked in a sunlit lot, with Arabic script alongside the French text. The bus has a modest design with black trim and a red line running along its side, and appears to be from a bygone era, suggesting a location where older vehicles are still in use. In the background, there's an entrance with traditional architectural features, including a rampart-like wall with crenellations. Also visible are modern cars of various colors parked haphazardly around the bus, contrasting with the bus's dated look. The sky is clear, indicating fair weather.
