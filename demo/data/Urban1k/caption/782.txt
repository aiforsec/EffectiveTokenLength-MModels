The image shows a bustling urban street scene featuring three double-decker buses lined up on a roadway. The buses have the livery of KMB and show route numbers 117 and 30A on the front displays. They exhibit a cream and red color scheme, with advertisements on the side. Surrounding the buses are various street-level shops with signs and an overhead traffic light. In the background, there appear to be residential or commercial buildings with numerous windows, suggesting a densely populated city environment. A blue and white vehicle, possibly emergency services, is partially visible in the foreground, moving along the road.
