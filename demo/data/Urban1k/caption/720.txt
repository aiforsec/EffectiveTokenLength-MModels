This image captures a cluttered urban intersection with multiple traffic signs and signals. A red traffic light is visible at the top left of the image. Below it, signs indicate F.D.R. Drive with a leftward arrow, the naming of "Nelson & Winnie Mandela Corner," and "East 42nd St." A white "One Way" sign with a leftward arrow and a black and yellow pedestrian crossing sign stating "ATTENTION DRIVERS" are situated below these. Additional regulatory signs inform about "NO STANDING Anytime" and parking rules enforced Monday through Saturday with the option to "Pay at Muni-Meter." The background features a building's glass facade and the street-level exterior of a business with the word "innova."
