The image depicts an urban street scene at dusk or dawn with artificial lights visible. A person wearing a bright yellow reflective safety vest appears to be directing or managing traffic with their back to the camera. There's a gold-colored sedan in motion, partially visible in the foreground, and the tail lights suggest it is braking or about to make a turn. Another individual is seen standing on the sidewalk looking towards the direction of the car, dressed in a dark coat. The street signs and buildings indicate a downtown setting, and the lighting suggests low visibility, thereby requiring the safety vest for visibility.
