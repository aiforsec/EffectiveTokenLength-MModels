A person is riding a bright blue bicycle along a wet brick-paved street, holding an umbrella for cover, suggesting it might be raining. The cyclist, likely a woman given the appearance of clothing and footwear, is dressed in a navy coat, dark trousers, and boots, and is carrying a shoulder bag. To the left of the image, a metal security shutter covering a storefront is visible, featuring advertisements for several food items. Behind the cyclist, a row of bicycles is parked along a metal railing beside a waterway, indicative of an urban setting. Gray, overcast skies imply a gloomy weather condition.
