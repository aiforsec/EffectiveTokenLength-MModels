The image features a fleet of buses parked in what appears to be a bus depot or station. In the foreground is a two-story double-decker bus painted in a bright yellow and deep orange livery. It has a curved front with a large windshield and is numbered '92'. Behind, and slightly to the right, is another double-decker yellow bus with red and blue accents. In the background, various other buses with similar colors can be seen, suggesting they all belong to the same transport company. The sky is overcast with white and grey clouds, and there are trees on the horizon behind the buses.
