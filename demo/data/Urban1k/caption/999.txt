The image captures a two-story green and yellow double-decker bus with the "LONDON COUNTRY" livery parked outside a vehicle depot. Text on the front top of the bus reads "196 Sorry not in Service". There's a small white utility van visible inside the depot, parked towards the back. The depot buildings have a white sign with "LONDON" emblazoned on one side and "COUNTRY" on the other, suggesting a dividing line between regions or operational areas. A clear sky with few clouds provides a bright backdrop. The vehicles appear to be from an earlier era, indicative of historical or retro transportation services.
