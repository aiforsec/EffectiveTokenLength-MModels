In this nighttime scene, a city bus is prominently positioned on the right, with its destination sign lit indicating it is bound for "Main St." This bus has a predominantly white and dark color scheme with visible route numbers near the top. It sits on a snow-covered street, reflecting the orange hue of the street lights, with streaks and accumulation of snow visible on the road's surface. Flurries are actively falling, evidenced by the specks caught in the glow of the streetlights. To the left, a construction site is partially visible, enclosed by a fence with bright construction lights, which shine over the scaffolding and construction materials.
