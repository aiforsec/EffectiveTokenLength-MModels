The image depicts an urban street scene with a focus on a shiny black SUV in the foreground. In the background, a brown brick multi-story building occupies the left side, with the skyline showing taller buildings with reflective windows. Overhead, there is a traffic signal with red and yellow lights visible, hanging diagonally across the frame from a metal pole on the right. There are several street signs, one indicating directions to the Queens Midtown Tunnel. A tree peeks out from behind the traffic light pole, adding a touch of greenery to the predominantly gray and brown urban palette. The sky appears clear with a soft light suggesting it could be morning or late afternoon.
