In the harbor, a large green and white fishing trawler is moored with 'MAGGIE M. MBE' printed on its hull. Two men are working on the deckâ€”one in red, crouched while handling equipment and the other in black, overseeing. The foreground is cluttered with maritime gear: a pile of varying-sized ropes and nets in shades of green, black, and brown, with scattered orange and black floats. A forklift at the ready sits in the background to the right. The dockside scene, under a bright blue sky, shows a glimpse of the town's waterfront architecture in the distance, evoking bustling seafront activity.
