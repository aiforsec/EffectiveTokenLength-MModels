This image showcases the imposing fa√ßade of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris with its twin towers and elaborate Gothic architecture, including the large circular rose window. In the foreground, a traffic signal displays a green light, to the right of which is a no-entry sign. A plush toy, possibly a gray dolphin with a floral garland, is perched on the traffic light control box. Visitors and locals are seen milling around the cathedral, with cars and a white van on the road. Scaffolding is visible on the left side of the building, hinting at restoration or maintenance work. Leafless trees suggest the photo might have been taken in a cooler season.
