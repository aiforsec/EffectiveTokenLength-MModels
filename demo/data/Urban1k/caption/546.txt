This image captures a bustling urban street scene. The foreground shows a blue public bus with its rear to the viewer, displaying route number 17. The left of the scene features traffic lights with a mixture of red and green signals and a “NO TURNS” sign. The road is shared by cars, a cyclist, and pedestrians. Striped crosswalks are visible at intervals. On the right, pedestrians are going about their activities. Leafless trees line the street, and banners reading "Shen Yun" are suspended between the trees. Overhead, numerous traffic signals and streetlights clutter the sky, while buildings recede into the background under a clear, bright sky.
