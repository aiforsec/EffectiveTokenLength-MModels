The image shows a white garbage collection truck branded 'DENNIS' driving on an urban street. The vehicle has orange warning lights on its top front corners and appears equipped with a compacting unit at the rear. There is visible grime and dirt, a common characteristic of operational waste collection trucks. The truck also features a left-hand drive configuration, suggesting it might be located in a country where vehicles are driven on the right side of the road. Two individuals wearing high-visibility vests can be seen in the cabin of the truck, indicating that they are the operators managing waste collection. Buildings and greenery line the background, typical of a city environment.
