The image features a clear day with blue skies. In the foreground, there's a blue double-decker bus labeled "15 16" parked by the side of a road. This bus displays a destination sign for "Reading Station via 844", and an advertisement for "ALEX CROSS" on its side. Behind it, another similar double-decker bus is visible, also with an advertisement. Both are situated on a tarmac surface. In the background, several more buses and a green traffic light can be seen. A building with a grey facade is prominent, and behind the buses, street lamps and leafless trees are scattered along the pavement.
