The image captures a busy urban street scene on an overcast day. On the left, a pedestrian walks by a bank named "Caixanova," with blue signage and an ATM adjacent. The corner building hosts a business with a dark facade and signage that reads "FORNE ASOCIADOS / Marketing Inmobiliario." Central to the image is a black station wagon driving away from the viewer with a visible license plate. The right side features a pharmacy with a blue cross emblem and a clothing store with mannequins in the display. Pedestrians are gathered near a zebra crossing, waiting to cross, and there is a pale yellow building at the end of the perspective.
