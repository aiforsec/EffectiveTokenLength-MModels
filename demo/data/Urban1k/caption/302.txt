A skateboarder performs a mid-air trick on a sunny day, with his skateboard beneath his feet. The sunlight creates a lens flare that adds a dynamic element to the photo. The setting appears to be an urban plaza with a mix of modern and traditional architecture including a building with reflective glass windows and a structure with brick walls. Onlookers observe from a distance, some seated on ledges. The clear sky and shadows suggest late afternoon or early evening. Another skateboard lies on the ground, enhancing the casual, leisurely atmosphere typical of a skateboarding spot. The skater is dressed in casual attire ideal for the activity.
