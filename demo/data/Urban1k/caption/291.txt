The image depicts a city bus parked on the side of a tree-lined street in an urban environment during the day. The bus, marked with the number 2101, has a primarily white body with a horizontal stripe pattern in red and purple hues along its sides. The destination sign on the bus's front reads "T IN SERVICE". Its side mirrors are extended outward, and the bus has a visible yellow pole likely for passengers to hold near the entrance. In the background, there are other vehicles on the road, including a car directly behind the bus, and high-rise buildings that suggest a downtown setting. A yellow fire hydrant is also noticeable at the curbside near the front of the bus.
