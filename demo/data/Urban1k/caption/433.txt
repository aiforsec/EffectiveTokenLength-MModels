This image shows a parking meter machine prominently in the foreground with a dark-colored sedan parked directly behind it. The meter has a green outer casing and features a digital display, a keyboard, and instructions for its use, including coin and card slots. A yellow instructional sticker on the machine's top informs about the parking meter rules. In the background, across the street, is a CVS/pharmacy store with a visible red and white sign, its facade mostly in red with a Beauty, Photo, and Pharmacy labeled. It's daytime, and the setting suggests an urban street scene.
