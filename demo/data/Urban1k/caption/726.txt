A line of hefty tow trucks from SSH Recovery parked along a curbside under an overcast sky. The leading vehicle, primarily blue with red and white stripes, prominently features a large grill and headlights, with a glimpse of its specialized equipment visible. The second truck mirrors the design and color scheme of the first. A standard white coach with red and blue detailing and a flatbed vehicle carrier with a pink car on top follow in the procession. There are modern buildings in the background, suggesting an urban environment, and the tarmac appears wet, indicating recent rain.
