The image captures a bustling European square, likely in the early evening given the soft lighting. In the foreground, a classic horse-drawn carriage waits, with the coachman clad in traditional attire, including a dark hat, engaging with the horse. The carriage is predominantly white, with spoked wheels and a plush red seat. The horse is in harness, sporting a light brown coat. Behind this Old World transportation, a striking gothic-style church with two prominent spires looms dramatically. Elegant buildings with stucco facades in warm shades of pink and yellow frame the square. Pedestrians can be seen milling about the area, adding a sense of vibrancy.
