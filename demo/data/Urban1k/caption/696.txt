The image depicts an urban street scene with a white articulated electric trolleybus, featuring a destination sign that reads "7 Haight Stanyan." The trolleybus has advertisements on its side and is connected to overhead wires. To its right is a white shuttle bus marked "COMPASS TRANSPORTATION" parked parallel to the trolleybus. In the forefront, a cyclist rides on the road, pedaling away from the viewer. The background reveals a bustling cityscape with modern buildings, traffic lights, and a clear blue sky. Shopfronts, including one with blue signage, are visible further down the street. The scene is bathed in sunlight, indicating either morning or afternoon.
