A red and blue public transport bus is prominently displayed in the foreground, labeled with the number 81 and the destination 'Merry Hill via Dudley'. The bus, with a reflection on its surface, appears to be pulling up to a bus stop where two individuals are waiting. The bus stop has a blue sign with white text indicating the directions and bus numbers serviced. There is a white printed notification on the bus stop's pole, and the setting is urban with buildings in the background and a clear sky above. A silver car is parked on the side of the street, partially visible behind the bus stop.
