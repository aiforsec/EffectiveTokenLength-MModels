A blue and silver train bearing the number 185 131 arrives at a station with clear skies in the background. The station platforms, marked with yellow lines, are largely empty with a few visible passengers. Platform signs indicate "4" and "5," suggesting multiple tracks. The sun is low in the sky, hinting at early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows on the ground from various columns and structures. Overhead lines above the train suggest electric power. The overall ambiance is calm with bright sunlight washing over the scene.
