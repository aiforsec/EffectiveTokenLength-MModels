The streetcar has multiple windows and a pantograph on top connected to overhead wires, indicating it is an electric vehicle. It's surrounded by urban scenery including lampposts, a tree-lined sidewalk, and a cylindrical advertisement kiosk. In the background, there are moving cars and blurred pedestrians, suggesting a bustling city environment. Light blue sky suggests a clear day.
