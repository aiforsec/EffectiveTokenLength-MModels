A night scene on a rain-slicked street with tram tracks running down the center. A green tram is in the distance, its lights glowing against the dark, wet ambiance. Streetlights cast an orange and white glow over the scene, reflecting off the wet surfaces. The right side of the image shows a sidewalk with a pedestrian railing and ornate architecture, including a sculpture on the side of a building, while the left side of the image features buildings with closed shutters. The yellow road markings are wet and reflective, and rain can be seen falling in the illuminated areas of the photo.
