This image shows the facade of a dilapidated, weathered two-story building with evident signs of age and neglect. The lower level features large windows and doors, some of which are boarded up, while the upper level has six evenly spaced windows, with only the central four being intact. The exterior is adorned with various graffiti tags and street art. Messages and posters can be seen around the entrance stairway, which is flanked on both sides by bicycles. In front of the building, mismatched chairs and a table suggest a makeshift seating area. The structure has an aged patina, and the cobbled street adds to the old-world charm of the scene.
