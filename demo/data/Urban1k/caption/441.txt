The image captures a scene on a street at twilight, with a black double-decker bus prominently parked to the right, featuring an advertisement for "The Ghost Bus Tours." The bus is labeled as belonging to the "Necrobus" company, with a partly visible telephone number and website. Behind the black bus, there's a classic red London double-decker bus in motion, creating a blur of red. The street is lined with bare trees and an ornate, well-lit building with white fa√ßade and architectural detailing. The pavement reflects the ambient light, suggesting the street may be damp. There are no visible pedestrians.
