A red fire engine labeled "ENGINE ELEVEN" dominates the foreground of the image, clearly marked "POTTSVILLE" on its front bumper. The fire truck features chrome detailing, warning lights, and a grille, with side compartments and hoses visible, suggesting its readiness for emergency response. The driver is visible through the front window. In the background, a stone building with stained-glass windows can be seen, which appears to be a church. A golf cart with two passengers wearing yellow sits behind the fire engine. People, including children, are crossing the street, and there's a prominent stop sign to the right. The environment suggests a small-town setting, with an overcast sky overhead.
