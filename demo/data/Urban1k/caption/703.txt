A large blue vintage-style bus with the text "Ulriksbanen" on its side dominates the foreground. Its license plate reads "ST 43337". Facing us, the bus has a front grille resembling a retro vehicle, with chrome details and circular headlights. An orange tent with promotional material is set up beside it on the sidewalk, behind which people are gathered at a stall. In the background, modern buses travel along the street, and urban traffic is visible, including cars and pedestrians. Traditional European buildings, densely packed and ascending a hill, provide a scenic backdrop under an overcast sky, suggesting a busy, metropolitan European city.
