This image shows a street scene outside a classical stone building with arched windows and doorways. One of the entrances is labeled as a Post Office with a sign indicating the availability of foreign currency exchange. There is scaffolding along part of the façade, indicating construction or renovation work. In the foreground, a large sign says "GRAND ARCADE," suggesting the building’s use as a shopping center or commercial arcade. Promotional visuals are partially visible behind the sign displaying what appears to be a collection of luxury goods. Several individuals, including two cyclists, are passing by the entrance, and the sky is clear, suggesting a bright, sunny day.
