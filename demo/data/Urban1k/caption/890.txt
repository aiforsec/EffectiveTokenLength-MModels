The image depicts an old double-decker bus on a street, presumably in an urban setting. The bus is primarily cream-colored, with maroon on its lower half and a stripe of maroon along the upper side. It displays a destination sign for Birmingham, indicating its service route. The vehicle registration plate is visible. A man in light-colored clothing stands at a bus stop by the curbside, seeming to wait for the bus or in the process of boarding. Office buildings with modern facades line the street behind the bus, and a streetlamp is visible to the right. The sky appears clear, suggesting fair weather conditions.
