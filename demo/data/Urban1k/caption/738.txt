This image shows a silver, white, and red coach from 'WILLIAMS - BALA', parked on a street. The vehicle registration plate is visible. There are reflective stripes and the word 'GLEN' on the front bumper. The coach is a left-hand drive vehicle and has tinted windows stretching along the side. In the background, there is another red bus or coach labeled 'Rhondda'. A pedestrian is also visible, walking on the pavement away from the viewer. The location appears to be an urban street with buildings, including what might be an industrial structure with a tall chimney in the near distance.
