The image shows a light blue urban transit bus with the number 117 prominently displayed on it, parked or stopping on a city street. The bus has a darker blue strip along the bottom and an electronic display sign above the windshield with text indicating the bus's route information. On the sidewalk beside the bus, there are pedestrians and a cyclist; one pedestrian is wearing a white shirt, and the cyclist is wearing a black shirt and sunglasses. Trees line the street, and the backdrop includes a clear sky and urban buildings, one of which has a "LOUNGE" sign on its fa√ßade. The bus appears to be in service, and there's activity around it, suggesting a routine urban setting.
