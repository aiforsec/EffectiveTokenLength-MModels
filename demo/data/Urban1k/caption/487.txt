In this urban street scene, two individuals are seen exiting a storefront, carrying surfboards and other items. The first person is holding a white surfboard with black and dark green graphics, tucked under their arm. They are wearing black shorts, a dark t-shirt, and black sneakers with white soles. Just ahead, the second person is clad in gray pants, a gray hoodie, and gray sneakers, glancing down at a box on the pavement. The box, branded with the word "FCS," suggests surfing equipment. Nearby, a street sign indicates "2 HR Parking," and vehicles line the curb. An overcast sky hints at a gloomy or rainy day.
