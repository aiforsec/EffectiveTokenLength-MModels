The image shows an urban street intersection with vehicular and pedestrian activity. In the foreground, there's a pedestrian crossing the street marked with white zebra lines and a black car in the middle of the crosswalk. The traffic light for pedestrians is visible, displaying a red hand signal indicating a "Do Not Walk" command. A man wearing a white jacket and dark pants is seen walking away from the camera, carrying a black bag in his left hand. To the left, another pedestrian appears to be wearing a white and red outfit crossing the street. Buildings with varying facades line the street, and clear blue skies with scattered clouds are above.
