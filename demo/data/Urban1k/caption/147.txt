This image shows a daytime street scene with a view of a traffic light set against a mountainous background. The traffic light displays a green signal, allowing vehicles to proceed. To the left of the traffic light, there's a road sign with a left turn arrow. Near the top center of the photo hangs a street name sign reading "Kirk Douglas Way." The road appears to be a multi-lane thoroughfare with a few cars traveling and some parked alongside the curb. The landscape is arid, with sparse vegetation, and the mountains in the distance have a hazy appearance possibly due to the heat or distance. The sky is bright and mostly clear.
