The image features a classic red double-decker bus parked on what appears to be an urban street, possibly in London. The bus has a bright red body with white window frames, and its design suggests it might be a vintage or heritage vehicle. It has a rounded front with a prominent grill and headlights, and the traditional open rear entrance for passengers. The lower deck has larger windows, while the upper deck windows are narrower. On the side, there is a circular logo and text, along with advertising banners, one in blue and another in red, suggesting its use for touristic purposes.
