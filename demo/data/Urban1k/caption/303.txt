This image depicts a multi-lane highway leading up to a toll booth station with a bridge structure in the background. On the right side, there is a road barrier and traffic cones indicating a detour or closed lane. Several vehicles are present on the road, including cars and a van, moving in both directions, with some approaching the toll booths. The sky is overcast with patches of blue. The toll station is flanked by two decorative towers with intricate designs. Overhead, thereâ€™s a gantry with traffic signals and signs, yet the text is not legible. In the distance, cables from a suspension bridge rise into the sky.
