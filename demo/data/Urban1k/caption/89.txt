This image features a double-decker bus, predominantly painted in bright yellow, with blue and red accents forming a rose design on its side. The bus is on a road, and its destination display indicates it is servicing the Manchester X41 route. Buildings with red brick facades and signage are visible in the background, suggesting an urban setting. There is also a glimpse of another red vehicle, likely a bus, and a pedestrian crossing sign, which suggests the bus is near an intersection or a designated stop. The license plate of the bus is visible, and the daytime lighting indicates it could be a late morning or afternoon.
