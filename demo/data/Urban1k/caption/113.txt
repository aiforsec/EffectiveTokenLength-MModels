This image shows a bustling outdoor bus terminal under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds. There are several white buses, some with colorful stripes or decorations, parked or in motion. Multiple people are dispersed throughout the scene: some walking, a few sitting on the pavement, and others conversing or waiting. In the background, there are two tall construction cranes towering over the area, suggesting nearby development or construction activity. The ground appears to be a mix of paved surfaces and patches of grass, with some areas looking worn or uneven. Electrical or light poles are visible, one prominently in the foreground.
