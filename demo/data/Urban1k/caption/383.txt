A procession of white goats is being led down a street in a quaint town, with a backdrop of European-style buildings, including a caf√© named "Laimbacher." Onlookers line the sidewalk observing the scene, some taking photographs. One individual, dressed in traditional attire with a red waistcoat and yellow trousers, guides the animals. Flags are displayed on one of the buildings, suggesting a festive or cultural event. The atmosphere appears to be lively, as the crowd watches the goats and their herders participating in this traditional parade amidst the urban setting. Cars parked along the side of the road hint at the blend of modern life with traditional customs.
