A parade scene with a vintage red pickup truck carrying a character wearing an oversized, comical leprechaun costume. The leprechaun has a large faux beard, green top hat, and a green coat, waving to the crowd. In the truck's bed, signs invite onlookers to a pub for entertainment. A woman stands behind the leprechaun, facing away from the camera, dressed in black. Bystanders line the street, dressed in casual attire, some wearing green, suggesting the event is likely a St. Patrick's Day celebration. City buildings provide the backdrop for this lively, festive occasion.
