We see a city bus parked on an urban street during daytime. The bus is predominantly white with blue and light blue accents near the rear. It's a single-decker bus, with the fleet number "2465" visible on the top corner near the front. The bus displays a destination sign above the windshield, indicating it's heading to the city. Dark tinted windows span the side of the bus, while the front door is open, suggesting it may be loading or unloading passengers. The vehicle is equipped with side mirrors and appears well-maintained. A pedestrian walks on the sidewalk in the background, and a tree is situated near the bus, along with city infrastructure and buildings in the vicinity.
