The image shows the facade of a shop named "PINOCCHIO FANCY DRESS" prominently displayed above a storefront. The black background with white and yellow lettering creates a stark contrast. To the left, there is a statue of a black and white cow positioned on the pavement. The cow statue is life-sized, with prominent black spots on a white base. There is a display window featuring various costumes, including a gold shiny dress. A man stands to the left of the entrance, dressed in dark clothing, seemingly engaged with something in his hands. The shop advertises dress hire services and it seems to specialize in costumes. The architecture suggests an urban setting with a relatively clear sky above.
