A bustling urban street scene with a red and yellow articulated bus marked 'Brighton & Hove' occupying the foreground, emblazoned with the number '25' and route information indicating it serves universities, city centre, and Hove. Pedestrians are walking across the street and along the sidewalks, while a group of people congregates outside a building with 'Britannia' and British flags on its signage. Vehicles—including a white car and a motorbike—are visible on the road. Traffic lights stand at an intersection, and bicycles are parked on a rack to the left. The atmosphere suggests a lively city environment, possibly during late afternoon given the soft lighting.
