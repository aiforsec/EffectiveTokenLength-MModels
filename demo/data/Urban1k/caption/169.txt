An ornate green street clock labeled "Coronado" stands prominently in the foreground of a bustling urban scene at dusk. The background features a grand, classical-style building with a domed roof and stately columns, bathed in the soft glow of evening light. Cars are visible on the road, with traces of their movement suggested by the blur of tail lights. Pedestrians are scattered about, some near a colorful fountain on the right that casts a vibrant spray into the air. Benches line the paved walkway, which is surrounded by lush greenery and street lamps that add a quaint charm to the scene.
