A red fire truck is parked on a suburban street, partially on the sidewalk, with its front doors open. Two firefighters, dressed in blue uniforms, are standing near the truck, engaged in a conversation with a civilian wearing a black top and patterned pants. Behind them, the area is bordered by a metal chain-link fence on the left and a grassy hill in the background. The sky is overcast. To the right, the road continues, flanked by yellow bollards, and another non-emergency vehicle is visible in the distance. An insignia is visible on the front of the fire truck, but the text remains indistinct.
