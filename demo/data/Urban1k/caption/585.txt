A modern streetcar adorned with colorful advertising graphics travels down an urban thoroughfare, its pantograph connected to the overhead electric lines. The streetcar, labeled "WESTLAKE HUB," operates on tracks set into the pavement. Lush green trees line the sidewalk to the right, and a mix of traffic signals and lampposts punctuates the skyline. To the left, a multi-story building with rounded balconies and a red sign on the roof appears. The area appears well-maintained, with visible street marking and a dedicated streetcar lane. In the background, construction signs and cones suggest ongoing development or road work.
