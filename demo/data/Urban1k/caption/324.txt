This is a daytime image of a street intersection with various vehicles waiting at a traffic signal. In the foreground, there's a traffic light post with a blue directional road sign above it pointing to the right, showing distances to two different locations. The traffic light itself reveals a black casing with multiple signals, but the lights are not visible due to the angle of the photo. Attached to the post at street level, there's a red and white triangular yield sign facing the opposite direction. The background displays a row of cars, illustrating a mix of models in different shades of silver, blue, and red, queued up on the road. A lamp post with a curved arm bearing a light fixture is noticeable in the distance, against an overcast sky.
