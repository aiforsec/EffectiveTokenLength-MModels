This image depicts an urban street scene where two individuals are riding bicycles across a crosswalk. The cyclist closer to the foreground is mounted on a classic bike with a silver frame, while the rider further away is on a red and green bicycle. In the background, a Millennium BCP bank branch with red signage can be seen, and above the bank, there are directional road signs pointing to various locations. A small hatchback car is also visible in the left foreground of the scene. It appears to be an overcast day, and the environment suggests a European city setting due to the architecture and signage.
