This image captures an old sandstone clock tower in the center of a sunlit public square. The tower features ornate detailing and a black clock face, with flags, including those of the European Union and what appears to be a regional flag, flying from a balcony. Below, people are walking on the square's paving stones, with some approaching the shaded entrance beneath the tower. To the right, there are outdoor umbrellas indicating a caf√© or a gathering spot. Street lamps and a clear blue sky can be seen, suggesting a peaceful, sunny day. Buildings with shuttered windows surround the square, adding to the European ambiance.
