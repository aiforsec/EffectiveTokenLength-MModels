This image shows two parked buses in a parking lot with a rocky hillside in the background. The bus on the left has a predominantly white front with red and purple side stripes, marked with the number 3 and the brand GMC; notably, it has a large front chrome grille and orange rooftop clearance lights. Below, orange traffic cones are placed in front of it. The bus on the right features a tan or beige color scheme with a horizontal striped design on the front. There's a black vehicle partially visible behind the right bus. The parking lot is asphalt and the sky is overcast, suggesting a cool or cloudy day.
