This image features a close-up of a brown horse's head with a focused look, adorned with a black harness decorated with silver studs. The horse is part of a carriage, as suggested by the partial view of the wheel on the left. Part of the bridle is red, and the reins are connected to a silver bit in the horse's mouth. In the background, a bustling city street scene unfolds with cars, typical yellow taxis, and a pedestrian crossing. Buildings with large windows line the street, and a blue flag hangs from one structure, all basking in clear, bright daylight.
