This image displays a freeway road scene with a large green overhead road sign indicating upcoming exits. The left side of the sign states "Exit 54B Coast Hwy 1/2 MILE," and the right side indicates "Exit 54C Oceanside Harbor Dr Camp Pendleton" with an arrow pointing right, suggesting that Exit 54C is approaching imminently. The background shows a clear sky with some scattered clouds, a line of palm trees along the road, and multiple lanes of traffic with various vehicles. The highway itself appears to be busy, with cars visible in the lanes, yet traffic seems to be flowing smoothly.
