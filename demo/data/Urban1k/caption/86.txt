A police officer rides a black and white motorcycle down a city street during a sunny day. The motorcycle is equipped with emergency lights, a windshield, and side mirrors; it also displays the word "POLICE" prominently on the side. The officer is dressed in a dark uniform with a protective helmet and sunglasses, and is looking to the side. Behind the officer, a crowd lines the street, with some people sitting and others standing. Some spectators hold small American flags, suggesting the event may be a parade or a civic holiday celebration. Trees line the sides of the street, providing shade for the gathered spectators.
