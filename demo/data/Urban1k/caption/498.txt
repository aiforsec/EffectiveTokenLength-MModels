In the foreground, a street sign indicates that diagonal crossing is permissible. The photograph shows a cloudy day with wet roads reflecting a recent rain. Two pedestrians, one in a beige coat and one in a black jacket, cross the street. The architecture includes red-brick buildings with commercial establishments on the ground floor, including a Starbucks Coffee visible in the background. A red and gray bus is also in view, and a few people are scattered across the wide street. Vivid traffic lights and street lamps are evident. Despite the overcast sky, the scene captures a typical urban street atmosphere.
