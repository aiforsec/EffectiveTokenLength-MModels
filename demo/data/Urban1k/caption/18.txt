In the image, a single-decker public transport bus is parked in a bus depot under a bright blue sky. The bus exhibits a white base color with pink and purple stripes on the lower half, and it has the First Bus company logo on the side. The destination display at the front of the bus reads "Wincanton 58A" in black letters. To the left, part of a blue bus with "damory.co.uk" written on it is visible. The scene is set against a backdrop of traditional brick houses with red-tiled roofs, and a modern, dark-colored saloon car is parked to the right behind a metal fence.
