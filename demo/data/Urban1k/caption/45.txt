A commuter train painted in a blue and red striped livery approaches a station platform under an overcast sky. The train features the number 213 and is led by a locomotive with a distinctive sloped nose. Overhead, signal lights are mounted on a metal gantry, ready to manage rail traffic. Just behind the train, multi-story brick buildings line the street, indicating an urban setting. To the left of the photo, utility poles and power lines run parallel to the tracks. The platform itself is edged by a yellow safety line, and a single orange cone is visible near the foreground.
