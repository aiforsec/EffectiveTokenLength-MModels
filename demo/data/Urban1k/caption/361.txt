This image captures an urban street scene with a leafy boulevard. On the left, we see a traffic sign indicating one-way straight ahead, and a series of street lamps. A person riding a bicycle is passing by. On the right, the facade of a building with classical architecture presents large windows and ornate detailing. A trash bin is placed near a column at the edge of the sidewalk. In the middle ground, there is a line of parked cars and a black car in motion on the road. The colors are muted with shades of green from the trees and various grays from the pavement and architecture. The sky is overcast, suggesting either an early morning or a cloudy day.
