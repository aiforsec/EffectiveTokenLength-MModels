This image depicts an urban street scene under a clear blue sky. The road is marked with yellow double lines down the center and is flanked by various two- to three-story buildings with flat and sloped roofs, some with visible siding. Vehicles, including cars and an ambulance, line the street. A green traffic signal at the forefront displays a red light. Street signs are attached to a traffic light pole on the right. A smattering of unleafed trees and street lamps line the sidewalks, and pedestrians are visible in the distance. Shadows indicate the sun is high, suggesting midday conditions.
