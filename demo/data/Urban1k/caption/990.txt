This image portrays a street corner under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a red stop sign with white lettering is prominently displayed, mounted on the same pole as two green street signs that read 'Medina St' and 'E 6th 1100,' indicating the street names and block number, respectively. A classic-style street lamp with a black finish is visible to the right of the signpost. The background includes a one-story gray commercial building with large windows and a flat roof on the left side of the street, and a fenced barren lot on the right. Parked cars and a few leafless trees complete the urban scene.
