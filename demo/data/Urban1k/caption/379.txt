The image shows an urban street corner on a sunny day, with red brick pavement and a black sedan stopped at a traffic light. A green street sign reads "DE LAFAYETTE" at the top, and underneath, there's a sign indicating "Washington St." with arrows pointing in both directions. Traffic signals are visible, with one showing a red light, and another for pedestrian crossing. There are multiple road signs, including a 'No Turn on Red' and parking regulation signs on pole. An ornamental street lamp stands adjacent to the signs. In the background, there's a brick building with large windows and a green tree peeking behind it.
