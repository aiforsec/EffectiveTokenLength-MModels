A modern articulated bus painted in a silver and red color scheme travels through a wet urban street, its headlights gleaming, signaling a rainy or misty day. The bus features a destination sign that reads 'PUBLIC SQUARE'. Surrounding the bus are brown and glass-paneled high-rise buildings. Visible signage includes '30 PUBLIC SQUARE SELF-PARK' and directional markers for parking. There is also a street sign with a 'bus' symbol and a red and white 'No Left Turn' symbol on it. A pedestrian signal is visible displaying a red hand, indicating a 'Do Not Walk' command. The overcast sky and reflective wet pavement suggest recent rain.
