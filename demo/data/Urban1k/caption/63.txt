The image captures a bustling street scene with two prominently displayed buses. On the left is a yellow, red, and white bus with the route sign visible, while on the right, a green, white, and black bus with the destination "CAVITE" on the front is loading or unloading passengers. People are seen walking on the sidewalks with some about to board the bus. Power lines crisscross above, and a communications tower looms in the background. In the background, there are also buildings, one of which has a sign for "GREAT PACIFIC." The sky is overcast, hinting at a cloudy day.
