This image captures a city street scene on a sunny day with a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a group of pedestrians is crossing the street, with one individual in a red top standing out. There is a traffic signal to the right, showing a red hand indicating a 'Do Not Walk' signal. To the left, there's a street lamp and the sign for S Canal St at the 500 W location. In the midground, cars are visible on the road, and a bus stop with waiting passengers is situated on the right sidewalk. The background features a variety of modern buildings, including high-rise apartments and office towers, with one prominently reflecting the sunlight. The overall image has a teal and orange color cast, giving it a somewhat vintage or filtered appearance.
