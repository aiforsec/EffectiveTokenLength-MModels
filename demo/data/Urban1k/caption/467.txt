A public transit bus is captured from a frontal angle under a clear blue sky with sunlight gleaming off its windshield. The bus's destination sign displays "NORWOOD" at the top. It has a prominent white number "5102" and beneath it, a smaller "2912." The visible section of the bus is predominantly white with blue stripes and green accents along its side. In front, the bus features a black bike rack. Behind the large windshield, a bus driver with light hair is visible. The bus's headlights and turn signals are off. The background suggests a parking or waiting area next to a building with a reddish brick facade.
