A silver sedan car is parked on a street in front of a classical building with large pillars and a sign that is obscured except for the word 'NATIONAL BANK.' A double-sided traffic signal pole with circular signs showing 'GO' in green and 'STOP' in red is visible beside the car. There are two individuals, one in the driver's seat of the car and another standing to the right behind the vehicle. In the background, there's a wooden bench and a vintage black carriage with large wheels, parked beside another similar carriage, suggesting a historic or touristic location. It's daytime with a partly cloudy sky.
