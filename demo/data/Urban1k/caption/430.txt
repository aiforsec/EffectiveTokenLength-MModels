This black and white photograph captures a street scene from a bygone era, likely in the mid-20th century judging by the vehicles' designs. Dominating the scene are two double-decker buses, with the nearer one marked "WORRICKER" on the side. The street has tram tracks embedded, and both buses are positioned on or adjacent to these tracks. Pedestrians are scattered throughout; some are walking along the sidewalk, while others are crossing the street or waiting by the bus. On the right, a cyclist rides alongside the curb. The buildings lining the street appear to be shops, with awnings extended over the sidewalk. There's a distinctly busy, yet orderly, urban atmosphere to the scene.
