This image features a daytime street scene with clear skies. Parked in the foreground is a dark blue or black Ford Expedition SUV towing a large white enclosed trailer with a pair of rear doors and taillights. Behind it, parallel to the street, is a sidewalk with a brown gravel strip. On the opposite side of the street, there is a small white car parked facing the opposite direction. A row of single-story buildings with salmon-colored walls and turquoise trim extends into the distance. Power lines and utility poles loom above, and lush green trees can be seen near the buildings, contributing to the suburban atmosphere.
