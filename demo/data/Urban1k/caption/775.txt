This image captures two mounted police officers patrolling a city street. Each rides a dark brown horse with black manes and tails. Both horses wear black bridles, and the hooves of the one on the left are partially covered by what appears to be beige protective gear. The officers are dressed in uniform with dark jackets, the one on the left wearing a black leather jacket and the other sporting a navy jacket with a visible badge or patch. They traverse a clear road with a green traffic signal ahead, and urban architecture and vehicles are in the background, indicating a bustling, downtown setting.
