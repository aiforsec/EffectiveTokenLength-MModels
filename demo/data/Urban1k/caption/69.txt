The image depicts an urban street scene with two police officers wearing high-visibility jackets walking away from the camera. Their jackets have the word "POLICE" on the back. A man in a brown jacket is walking alongside them, and another man in a dark hoodie is in front of them. There's an individual leaning against a building on the left side of the frame. A bright red delivery van labeled "Sun" is parked in the middle ground, and various other cars are visible. Traffic lights showing red can be seen in the distance. The architecture suggests a British setting with historical buildings, and the sky is overcast.
