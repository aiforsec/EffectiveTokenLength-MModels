This image captures a street view featuring the fa√ßade of a two-story building branded "ORANGE TREE IMP," which is potentially a business. The structure has a gable roof and is painted white with a contrasting black trim around the storefront. The ground level displays large glass windows with colorful displays, and a yellow sun motif decorates one of the windows. Adjacent to this establishment are other businesses, hinted at by partial signage and awnings. In the foreground, part of a silver sedan and the front end of a gray minivan are visible, parked on the street. A side-view mirror showing the reflection of another vehicle, possibly a Jeep, further indicates a busy street setting. Overhead, the sky appears overcast.
