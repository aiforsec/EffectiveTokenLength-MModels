This image captures a city street scene with three individuals and a parked car. In the foreground, a woman clad in a black and white striped shirt, black skirt, and green flats stands next to a red and white no entry traffic sign. Behind her, a man is crouched in a photographing position aiming his camera towards the street. On the right, another man leans against the building, holding a camera with a strap. The building fa√ßade features large window panes with a "TO LET" sign. Below, there's a silver car parked by the sidewalk. The scene appears calm with daylight conditions.
