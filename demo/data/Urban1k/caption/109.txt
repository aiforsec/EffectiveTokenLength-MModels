The image captures a street scene with buses and a pedestrian. Two buses are prominently visible with their destinations displayed: the nearest bus is marked "X95" and the one ahead is marked "Carlisle" via "X95". The buses bear the livery of "First" bus service with a color scheme of white, pink, and blue. On the left, there's an older woman standing on the pavement, clad in a red jacket, looking away from the camera. At the far end, another bus is parked, alongside other vehicles not fully shown. The setting appears to be in the late afternoon or early evening, judging by the long shadows and soft lighting.
