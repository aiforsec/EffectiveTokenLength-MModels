This image depicts an urban street scene where a yellow and green public transportation bus, with the number 36 and the destination "DOWNTOWN" displayed on its front sign, is approaching the camera. The bus is travelling on a street marked with multiple traffic lanes and dotted lines, as well as overhead cables, possibly for electric buses. The street is lined with parked cars of various colors, including white, red, and gray, on both sides. A traffic sign on the right suggests a mandatory right turn for the bus lane, while regular vehicles continue straight. Leafless trees and a cloudy sky suggest it might be a cold or overcast day. The overall atmosphere of the picture is of a typical, somewhat cloudy day in a residential neighborhood.
