This image shows a traditional ornate street clock with a black post and a white clock face, standing prominently on a sidewalk. The classic clock features roman numerals and elegant hands, surrounded by a detailed border. It is a sunny day with a clear blue sky above. The sidewalk is lined with red brickwork and concrete paving, leading past a series of commercial buildings with various storefronts. There are signs and awnings of different colors on the facades. In the background, there is a yellow construction crane towering above the roofline of the buildings. A red car is parked on the street beside the sidewalk.
