This image captures a traditional yellow American school bus in an urban setting, possibly in New York. The bus is designed with a flat front, known as a Type D configuration. Above the windshield, there is a lit-up sign that reads "SCHOOL BUS," indicating that the vehicle is in service. The bus has dark tinted windows, and a stop sign arm on its side. The bus number is "2011." The background reveals a city scene with leafless trees, indicating possibly autumn or winter. There are cars and another school bus visible behind the first bus, and tall buildings line the background, suggesting a downtown area. The sky is overcast.
