This urban street scene features several road signs and traffic signals at an intersection. A green street sign reads 'Union St.' hanging beside a traffic light. Below it, a directional traffic sign in green points towards 'City Centre' for routes A1, West 99, and North. Another sign indicates leaving the 'Historic Chinatown' area, written in both English and Chinese characters. An additional green sign with a maple leaf symbol suggests the direction East. The environment consists of a multi-lane road with vehicles, a pedestrian crossing, and urban buildings with a grey overpass structure in the background. Trees with autumn foliage are visible along the sidewalk.
