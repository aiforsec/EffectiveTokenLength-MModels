A dusk scene on an urban street with a double-decker bus painted in purple hues parked at a bus stop. The bus displays route number 6 and text indicating its destination. On the sidewalk, a young person wearing a green hoodie, striped pants, and carrying a bag walks away from the camera. The street is wet, reflecting the ambient light, and the sky is darkening. There is a shop with a green signboard to the left, and traditional brick buildings with lit windows in the background. "BUS STOP" is written on the road in large, faded yellow letters where the bus is parked.
