A white sedan with a blue and yellow emblem on the grill is parked in a lot with a yellow fire hydrant to its left. The lot appears to be somewhat worn, with visible patches and discoloration on the concrete. There's an assortment of other vehicles in the background, including a dark SUV, a silver truck, and a possibly maroon vehicle. Beyond the parking area, trees line the view and there are commercial buildings in the distance under a hazy sky suggesting either overcast weather or poor air quality. The license plate on the sedan is visible at the front.
