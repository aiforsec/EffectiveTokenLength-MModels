This image shows an urban street scene during daylight with clear skies. Centered in the foreground is a bright orange articulated bus that has pulled over to the side of the road, possibly at a bus stop. On the right, pedestrians are visible, including a person in a pink shirt and another in a white shirt. The street is lined with green trees, which partially obscure a row of multistory buildings in the background, with a mixture of residential and commercial architecture. The buildings have balconies, and there are signs of businesses on the ground floor. A white car travels down the road, approaching the rear of the bus.
