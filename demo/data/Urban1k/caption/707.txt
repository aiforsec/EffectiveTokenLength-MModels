This is an image of a city street where a public transit bus is prominently visible in the foreground. The bus is painted in a white, green, and orange livery, displaying a route number at the front above its windshield. It's a clear day, and the pavement appears dry. On the sidewalk to the left, there appears to be a brown trash receptacle and an older pedestrian with a walker. Parked cars line the street on the right, and various commercial signs can be seen in the background, suggesting this area is part of a bustling urban neighborhood. A silver-colored vehicle is directly behind the bus.
