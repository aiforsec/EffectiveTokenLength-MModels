Three colorful buses with a pink, yellow, and orange livery are parked next to each other on a busy street. They are modern coaches with large windshields, and one displays the MAN brand logo. The background is bustling with traditional multi-story buildings, signage in Chinese characters, and some scaffolding. An adult, possibly a woman based on the appearance from behind, wearing a greenish skirt and carrying a shoulder bag, is standing in the foreground. The person seems to be waiting or looking towards the buses. The street is paved and reflects the well-trodden urban environment typical of a dense Asian city.
