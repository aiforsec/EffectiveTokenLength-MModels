In the foreground, we see individuals dressed in winter attire and skiing equipment. Some are walking, while one is bent over adjusting their gear. Many skis are planted upright in the snow, and a few ski poles are visible as well. The building in the background is a two-story structure with a green roof and a partial stone facade. Flags from different countries are displayed on poles extending from the building's upper level. Various branded banners, including Fisher and Swix, are prominently positioned around the entrance, suggesting a ski-related event or gathering point. There is overcast lighting, suggesting a cold, wintry day.
