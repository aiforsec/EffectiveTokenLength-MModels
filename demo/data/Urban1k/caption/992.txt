This image captures an urban street scene on an overcast day, featuring a cyclist in the foreground riding on a designated bike lane, marked by greenery and a small curb separating it from the pedestrian pathway. The cyclist is wearing a dark outfit and a backpack, navigating a straight path, while a pedestrian walks in the opposite direction on the adjacent sidewalk. To the right, a line of parked cars ends with a city bus stopped by the sidewalk. Tall apartment buildings form the backdrop, stretching into the sky, with their various shades of white and grey. They stand in contrast to the green and yellow hues of the street-level scene, including the warning signpost at the bike lane's start.
