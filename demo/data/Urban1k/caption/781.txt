This image captures an urban street scene with a focus on two storefronts. On the left, a salon named "Peluquerias" is visible in lime green and white colors with a sign "AZAFRANES" above it. Next to it, on a wooden facade, is "R.C.LUME," seemingly a restaurant offering grilled cuisine as suggested by "PARRILLADA" on a vertical sign. The pavement is made of cobblestones, and there are posters and graffiti on the wall. A black cylindrical waste bin is near the corner. A pedestrian, partly captured, is seen walking away on the sidewalk. The overall setting appears European based on the architecture and signage.
