This image shows an urban street scene with a broken and tilted yellow traffic sign in the foreground, mounted on a black pole affixed to a concrete base. The base is cracked and the surrounding pavement is uneven. The background offers a view of a quiet street lined with two-story brick buildings housing various shops, including a business named "Moss." Vehicles, including a blue bus, white cars, and a van, are visible. The sky is overcast and the road appears damp. An illuminated red traffic light can be seen in the distance, hanging over the street.
