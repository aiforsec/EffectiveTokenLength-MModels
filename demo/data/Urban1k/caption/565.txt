This vintage photo captures a street scene with a classic trolley bus in the foreground, marked 9551, colored mainly in blue with white detailing. The bus appears to be stopped at a junction, connected overhead to electrical wires via twin poles. Behind it, there's a row of buildings bathed in the golden hues of a setting or rising sun, casting long shadows on the scene. A few pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk, while the street buzzes with old-fashioned vehicles, including an orange truck on the right. Overlooking the scene is a large industrial building with a 'HUDSON' sign on its roof.
