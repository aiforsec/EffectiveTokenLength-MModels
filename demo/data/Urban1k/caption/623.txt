The image shows two double-decker buses parked in front of a row of quaint colonial-style buildings with red-tiled roofs and white walls, lined with green trees. The bus in the foreground is predominantly white with red and yellow advertisements, while the bus at the back has a more colorful mixture of purple, black, and diverse imagery. Both buses display the number 62 on their front upper decks, suggesting a shared route. They exhibit vibrant, full-body advertising wraps which are common in urban settings. The windows and windscreens of the buses reflect the surrounding environment, blending the vehicles with the streetscape.
