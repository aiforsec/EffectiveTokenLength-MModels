A man wearing a jacket labeled "PARKING METER REPAIR City of S.F." is standing on a sidewalk, possibly engaged in maintenance work on a parking meter. He has a utility belt and is facing a set of toolbox trays filled with various tools and parts, which are resting on a metal stand. There are parked cars along the curb, including a silver sports car in the foreground. The scene is likely set in a city environment, with buildings and street signs visible in the background, and a tree-lined sidewalk stretching into the distance.
