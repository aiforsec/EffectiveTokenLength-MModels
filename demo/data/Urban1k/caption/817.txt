The image displays a city street scene with a fire in the middle of the road, emitting thick black smoke rising vertically. On the left, a crowd of pedestrians lines the sidewalk, their attention directed towards the fire. The streetscape is flanked by multi-story buildings with various shop signs and banners. The road is empty of traffic, save for the fire's presence. Street lamps and wires are visible above, and a concrete barrier with red and white striping runs alongside the near side of the road. The sky is overcast, casting a grey tone over the scene.
