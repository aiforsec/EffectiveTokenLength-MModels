An orange and white commercial concrete pump truck is parked on the side of a suburban road. The cab of the truck is white, and its main body and boom are orange. The extended boom of the pump truck is retracted and resting on the truck bed. Behind the truck, there is a grassy verge and a pedestrian path followed by a street lined with houses, trees, and utility poles. On the left, there's a white caravan parked in front of one of the houses. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting an overcast day.
