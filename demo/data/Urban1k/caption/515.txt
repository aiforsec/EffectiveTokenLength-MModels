This image shows a red and silver school bus parked on the side of a tree-lined street. The bus features a dark-colored front bumper with additional auxiliary lights, a large windshield, and blue-tinted windows. Above the windshield is a black sign with white lettering. The bus is adorned with a decorative strip with a wave-like pattern running along its side. The vehicle is parked on concrete paving, and there are other cars visible in the background. The photo is taken during the daytime under clear skies, casting soft shadows onto the pavement.
