This image depicts a miniature replica of an airport terminal, labeled "AEROPUERTO REINA SOFIA," with a variety of detailed elements that simulate a bustling airport scene. In front of the grey terminal building with a white roof are miniature figures of people queuing and vehicles such as colorfully painted cars, a yellow taxi, and a green and white airport shuttle bus at a pedestrian crossing. Behind the terminal are model airplanes—one with a prominent blue and white livery—positioned as if taxiing on the tarmac. The foreground shows rough terrain with pebbles and sparse vegetation, suggesting that the viewpoint is from an elevated position observing the miniature display.
