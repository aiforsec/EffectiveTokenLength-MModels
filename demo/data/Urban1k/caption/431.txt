A busy street lined with a variety of food trucks on the right, each with bright, colorful signage advertising food options such as "SAUSAGES." A prominent truck labeled "TOMMY'S CHIPWAGON" is closest to the camera. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, with a woman and two children near the center of the frame. Flags, including Canadian flags, hang from lamp posts above, and buildings with detailed facades can be seen in the background. The sky appears overcast, and items such as a wooden pallet and trash bags indicate utilitarian use behind the scene of street vending.
