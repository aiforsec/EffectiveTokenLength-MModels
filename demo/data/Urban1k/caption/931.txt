The image shows a classic red double-decker bus with the word 'BARTON' on its destination sign, indicative of its route or operator. The bus has a cream-colored lower deck window area and a silver front radiator grille, with the model number and a license plate that starts with 'ALR'. Positioned on a paved area, it appears to be taken from street level. Behind the bus, there is a partial view of a green bus, also likely vintage, and a brick building with white-framed windows. The setting suggests a bus depot or a transportation-themed event, with a clear sky hinting at calm weather.
