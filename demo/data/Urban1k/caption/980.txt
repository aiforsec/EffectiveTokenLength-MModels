This image depicts an urban street scene on a sunny day. In the foreground, there's a pedestrian crossing with red-painted markings and the word "LOOK LEFT" visibly written on the road. A woman carrying a blue shopping bag is about to step onto the crosswalk, and several other pedestrians are waiting by the roadside. Traffic lights and a tall black pole with buttons, likely for pedestrian signals, are present. A green hedge runs parallel to the road, behind which tall trees provide shade. In the background, there's a modern multi-story building with reflective glass windows, and multiple cars are visible on the street. The sky is blue and clear.
