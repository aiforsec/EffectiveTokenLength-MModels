A vintage green and cream-colored trolley bus is parked on a paved road near a construction site, with its route and number displayed at the top front. Overhead wires above the bus suggest it's electrically powered. The bus has a mid-century design, indicative of the 1950s or 1960s era. The road is partially obstructed by orange traffic cones and barriers, and a tarp-covered mound of construction material lies to the left. In the background, there are leafless trees, a streetlamp, a clear blue sky with scattered clouds, and typical suburban buildings. A red sedan is driving behind the bus, further indicating a mid-20th century setting.
