A city bus with the number 170 and destination display on its front is traveling on a tree-lined two-lane street. Autumnal trees with sparse leaves line the roadside against a partly cloudy sky. A road sign on the right indicates a crosswalk ahead, featuring a symbol of two people. Three cars appear further down the road, with one in the same lane as the bus and two in the opposite lane. On the left, there's a red and white sign partially obscured by branches, and a wooden fence runs alongside the sidewalk, bordering residential property. The atmosphere suggests a suburban area during a bright, calm day.
