A dusky evening scene on a city street, with the sky transitioning from blue to orange near the horizon. A sliver of the crescent moon is visible in the fading light. A double-decker bus, route number 7 to Marina, takes center stage; its headlights and interior are aglow, offering a sharp contrast to the dimming surroundings. Classic-style street lamps contribute a warm, yellow glow, complementing the twilight ambiance. Traditional multistory buildings line the street, having white facades that reflect the last of the day's light. In the background, modern high-rise buildings loom, with lit windows scattered across the structures. Several pedestrians are present, appearing to go about their evening routines.
