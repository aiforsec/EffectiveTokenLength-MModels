The image presents an urban street scene with a turquoise guidance sign in the foreground directing 'BIKES LEFT' with a left-pointing arrow and 'PEDESTRIANS RIGHT' with a right-pointing arrow. The sign is labeled 'Streets open at 1PM' related to 'SUMMER STREETS,' a presumably seasonal event. The wet pavement indicates recent rain, and orange traffic cones line the bike lane where cyclists are visible in the background, including a rider in white and another in dark attire. On the right, a pedestrian wearing inline skates stands on the sidewalk. City buildings and scaffolding frame the scene, with cloudy skies overhead.
