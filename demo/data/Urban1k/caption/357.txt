This image shows a line of city buses on a street with varying shades of gray, overcast skies. The buses are primarily white with blue and yellow accents, and they carry destination signs reading "Ruggles Sta." Each bus has a number at the top-front, suggesting different routes or designations. A black and white road sign indicating a merging traffic lane is visible in the foreground on the left. In the background, you can notice a partially visible brick building with distinctive architecture, a construction site with scaffolding, and a red crane towering above the scene, suggesting ongoing development or maintenance in the area.
