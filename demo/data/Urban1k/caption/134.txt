The image portrays a cloudy day over a busy street with multiple lanes. The overcast sky casts a grey hue over the scene. On the right, a bus lane is clearly marked with large white letters on the asphalt, adjacent to a bicycle lane symbolized by a white painted icon and a blue circular sign mounted on a post. A red car, seemingly at a halt, is visible within the frame of the bus lane, while another car appears to be moving in a regular lane to the left. Traffic lights further up the road display red signals. Trees and bushes are dotted around the background, contributing to the urban landscape. A street lamp is present to the far left, completing the urban setting.
