This image captures an urban street scene at an intersection. A cyclist, wearing a black helmet, sunglasses, and casual attire, waits at a red traffic light, straddling a red and black mountain bike. Behind him, pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks. To the left, a man carrying a bag walks past a stopped blue bus. A sandstone building with arched windows and detailing provides an architectural backdrop. Traffic lights are seen at multiple points, and road markings indicate a pedestrian crossing zone. The word "Look" is painted on the street, likely as a reminder for pedestrians to be vigilant.
