This image captures a traffic light post tilted precariously to one side in a winter setting with snow on the ground. The traffic light displays a red stop signal for pedestrian crossing, as well as a green light for vehicle traffic, indicating a possible malfunction due to the askew position of the post. There is a pedestrian road sign on top of the traffic light that is also tilted. A billboard with a colorful advertisement stands in the background behind the fallen post, with trees and a snow-covered park area visible as well. Parked cars are on the right side of the frame, with one closely positioned to the leaning post. The overall atmosphere suggests cold and overcast weather conditions.
