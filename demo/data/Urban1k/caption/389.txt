This image features a white articulated bus with blue and yellow accents on a road in front of a cream-colored two-story building with signage. The bus displays route number 715 and destination information on its front and side. The building has a black awning and multiple windows, with some signage visible on the fa√ßade. The ground floor appears to be a commercial premise while the second story has residential-style windows. There's a lush green tree behind the building, and the sky is clear blue, suggesting it might be a bright, sunny day. Shadows indicate sunlight coming from the left side of the frame.
