This image shows a bustling urban scene with three vehicles in the foreground. On the left is a bright yellow tram labeled "Kagoshima City Tram" with black text and numbering in black and white. In the center, a white taxi with a green stripe and roof sign is stopped beside the tram. To the right, a silver and blue articulated city bus with images of nature and mountains on its side panels is also stopped, and its destination board appears to be in Japanese. Behind the vehicles, a variety of buildings can be seen, including what looks like a multistory school or office building made of beige bricks, and in the background, a construction crane towers over the other structures. It is a clear day with blue skies.
