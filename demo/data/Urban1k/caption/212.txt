A large cruise ship bearing the name "Queen Elizabeth" is docked in the background, with part of its multilevel white structure visible. In the foreground, a blue bus with "Kingston" printed on its side is parked perpendicular to the viewer's perspective. Adjacent to the bus, there's a crane with a sizable boom extending upwards into the overcast sky. On the right, a portion of an old-fashioned brown train carriage is visible. The setting appears to be a transportation hub or port area with various modes of transport. The overall atmosphere is overcast, suggesting cloudy or gloomy weather conditions.
