The image shows a street scene in an urban environment during the daytime, with a clear sky hinting at good weather. On the right side, there are large green and blue waste containers lining the sidewalk, intended for garbage and perhaps recycling. Parked cars in various colors, including black and blue, line the left side of the street beside the waste containers. Two men are standing on the sidewalk, one closer to the foreground wearing a light-colored t-shirt and dark pants, the other farther in the background in a red top and darker bottoms. Multistory buildings, likely residential with balconies and storefronts on the ground level, flank the street, reflecting a typical cityscape. There are advertising signs on the buildings, and a white van marked with text is parked on the left side of the street.
