This image portrays an urban street scene with clear blue skies in the background. At the forefront, there's a wooden utility pole supporting various wires. Attached to it is a green traffic sign for "E Main St" intersecting another, unseen, street. Below the sign, there's a circular 'No Parking' sign with text and numbers. A two-hour parking limit sign is also visible. To the right, the corner of a building with a brown brick exterior and white-framed windows can be seen, along with striped awnings. On the left, another building with a stone fa√ßade hosts a market with white tents. There are multiple parked vehicles and a glimpse of a modern skyscraper in the distant background.
