A red and white tram with the number 1346 is the focal point of this urban scene, reflecting light on wet pavements indicating recent rainfall. It travels down tram tracks that intersect with vehicle lanes where various cars are parked or moving. The sky is overcast with grey clouds suggesting an early evening or a gloomy day. There are green trees to the left, slightly obscuring the view. In the background, there are old, multi-storeyed beige residential buildings with multiple windows, typical of urban architecture. A few pedestrians can be seen in the distance, and traffic lights and overhead tram wires crisscross above.
