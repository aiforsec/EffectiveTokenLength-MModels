This image shows a city scene with a public transportation bus at the center, labeled "10 TO CHICAGO/FRANKLIN," stopped on a street lined with tall buildings. A pedestrian with a green bag is walking on the sidewalk, and another person is standing waiting, possibly for the bus. American flags are mounted on the building in the background, fluttering in the breeze. There is a street lamp and a fire hydrant in the foreground. A silver SUV is visible on the street, and the general atmosphere suggests a cloudy day in an urban downtown area.
