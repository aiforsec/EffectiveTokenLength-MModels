A white Mercedes Actros semi-truck with a large cargo trailer is parked on a city street, partially obscuring a stoplight and a signpost with directions to Chippenham A4 and Stroud A46. Behind the truck, traditional multistory buildings with numerous windows line the street. The truck prominently features the Mercedes logo on its grille and has additional auxiliary lights mounted below. The vehicle's cab has a green stripe at the top and the driver can be seen in the left-hand driving position. The truck's registration plate indicates it is from the UK, reading "AY58 ABX." The scene is sunlit with clear skies above.
