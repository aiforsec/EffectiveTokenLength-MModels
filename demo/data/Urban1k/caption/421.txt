A public transportation bus is displayed prominently in the foreground, characterized by a combination of blue and white colors, with a hint of green and yellow graphics on the side panel. The bus appears equipped for an urban setting, indicated by 'EXPRESS' labeled on its front alongside a digital signboard mentioning a destination. A bicycle rack is mounted on the front of the bus, and it currently holds two bicycles, one with a blue frame and the other with a white and black frame. In the background, urban infrastructure is visible, including high-rise buildings and a structured red fencing around what seems to be a transit area. The streets are paved, and a black car can be glimpsed to the left of the bus.
