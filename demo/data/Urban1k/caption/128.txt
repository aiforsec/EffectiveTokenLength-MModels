This image captures a daytime street scene with a white double-decker tourist bus in the foreground, which reflects the colorful Victorian architecture of the surrounding buildings. The upper deck of the bus is visible with passengers inside. We see a row of Victorian-style houses with bay windows and decorative facades in the background. Above the street are multiple lines of overhead wires, likely for electric buses. There is a blue sky with a few clouds. A few parked cars line the street, and there's a convertible with its top down in the immediate foreground. Two flags, one rainbow and another national or possibly regional, hang from a building, indicating a likely diverse and possibly LGBTQ-friendly neighborhood.
