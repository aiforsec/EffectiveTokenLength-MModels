This image captures a busy urban street scene in rainy conditions. The foreground shows pedestrians, some carrying umbrellas, walking on a sheltered sidewalk, illuminated by the warm glow of string lights overhead. A blue articulated city bus labeled "FREE" is in motion, with blurred wheels suggesting movement. A stationary bicycle is parked at the curb, wet from the rain, reflecting the city's bustling, multimodal transportation environment. Tall buildings with reflective glass surfaces and a patch of green from street trees provide an urban backdrop. Traffic signs and lights add to the sense of an organized, though wet, cityscape.
