Commuters are boarding a blue and white city bus on a sunny day. The bus is parked beside a curb on a street lined with green trees in the background. Passengers form a neat line, waiting to enter through the front door of the bus. Men and women of various ages are present, dressed in business and casual attire. There's a road sign nearby with instructions specific to buses, indicating a designated area likely reserved for boarding. The bus features a large side mirror near its front and a number with a dash on its side, suggesting a route or fleet number. The scene suggests a routine urban commute, possibly during morning or evening rush hours.
