This image captures a scenic harbor with a bright blue sky partly dotted with cumulus clouds. A two-masted sailing boat with a brown hull and unfurled sails dominates the right foreground, tethered in calm water. Its reflection ripples gently. Several smaller boats, assorted in color and design, are moored alongside the quay, which retains the water with vertical timbers showing signs of marine growth. The waterfront is lined with a row of multistory buildings, exhibiting a variety of fa√ßades in pastel shades of pink, beige, white, and grey. People are visible, casually strolling and congregating along a walkway above the sea wall, overlooking the harbor.
