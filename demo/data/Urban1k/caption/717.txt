This image shows a blue double-decker bus on a road, with "Lancashire United" written on its side, partially obscuring the view of a stone building with a spire, possibly a church or historical building. The bus features teal and black graphics near the rear section. The sky is partly cloudy and a tree branch devoid of leaves can be seen in the top left corner. The setting appears to be a suburban street lined with two-story houses with pitched roofs, and there's a mix of vehicles parked and driving along the road, including a red hatchback and a silver car ahead of the bus.
