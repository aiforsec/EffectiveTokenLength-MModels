A city street view capturing vehicles at an intersection with traffic lights. The foreground shows a stationary, dark-colored SUV waiting at the red left-turn signal. A trolley crossing sign in yellow with a black outline of a trolley warns of a train intersection. To the right of the image, hanging green street signs indicate the cross street as 'San Carlos.' Pedestrians wait to cross, with two individuals standing on the sidewalk on the left. There's a hazy sky, which could suggest early morning or evening, diffusing the sunlight and casting a soft glow over the scene. Trees line the sidewalk, contributing to a typical urban landscape.
