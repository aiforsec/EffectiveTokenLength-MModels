This image captures two children on a sidewalk with bicycles and parked cars in the background. The child on the left is standing on a skateboard and is wearing a grey shirt featuring graphics, along with light-colored pants. He also sports a red cap. The child on the right is holding a snack package and is dressed in a yellow long-sleeve striped shirt with darker pants. There is a blue car and a silver car parked on the street, and at least two bicycles are locked to a metal bike rack. In the far background, an adult can be seen walking away from the scene. The setting appears to be a residential street with brick buildings and trees.
