This is a street view depicting a row of parked cars along a tree-lined sidewalk. In the foreground, a speed limit sign showing "30" is mounted on a utility pole, covered with several small stickers, directly above a green rectangular parking regulation sign that delineates a "2 HR PARKING 8 AM TO 6 PM" restriction. Further down the sidewalk, pedestrians are visible, including a woman with a ponytail wearing a white top and dark shorts. The signage suggests an urban, likely residential area during daytime given the shadows and ambient lighting. Shops with visible signage line the right side of the image.
