An orange city bus with the text "90 Hill-Venice" displayed on its front panel is in motion on an urban street, occupying the center of the view. Tall palm trees line the sidewalk, and a clear, blue sky is visible above. The architecture is characteristic of a downtown area, featuring a variety of mid-rise to high-rise buildings with a mix of modern and historical designs. Pedestrian traffic is light with one person standing by the sidewalk and another walking. Traffic signals indicate a green light for vehicles. The street has multiple lanes, and a mailbox and a white van can be seen in the background on the right.
