This image captures a double rainbow in a dusky sky after a rain. Two distinct arcs with spectral colors are visible against the grayish clouds. In the foreground, there are vehicles suggesting traffic at a stop, with red tail lights shining and a red traffic signal indicating a halt. Green foliage, slightly blurred likely due to wind or a moving vehicle from which the photo was taken, is seen on the right. There is a streetlight pole to the left. The environment suggests an urban setting, with a building structure visible in the background nested amongst trees. The scene has an overall rainy, reflective ambiance with wet surfaces and a calming after-storm feel.
