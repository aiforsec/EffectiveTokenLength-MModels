This image captures a coastal scene with a blue pickup truck parked on a wooden pier, where a person in a yellow jacket appears to be working on a small white boat. The wooden pier is lined with boulders on one side, leading to floating docks extending into the water. In the background, a large industrial structure, possibly a cooling tower emitting vapor, dominates the scene, suggesting the presence of a power plant. The sky is hazy, hinting at mist or humidity, and the water is calm. There are no visible waves, and the atmosphere seems quiet and still.
