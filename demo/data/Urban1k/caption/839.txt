This image shows a dramatic urban scene under a stormy sky. In the foreground, a blue tram travels along the tracks, with advertisements on its side. Pedestrians walk along a paved pathway next to the tram, one carrying a white bag. Behind, an unconventional building with undulating architecture captures attention, its facade in cream and pale yellow hues, and rooftops hinting at a dusting of snow or white paint. More traditional buildings with red roofs and architectural details flank the unique structure. The overall atmosphere is one of bustling city life juxtaposed against the anticipation of a storm.
