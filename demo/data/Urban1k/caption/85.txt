In the foreground, a worker in a high-visibility orange vest and hard hat holds a stop sign at a road construction site. The worker is standing next to a series of orange traffic cones that demarcate the work area. Behind him, an array of construction machinery, including a backhoe loader with a yellow front and a red truck with its bed raised, can be seen. There are trees lining the area, suggesting a suburban setting. On the left, there is a black car waiting, its front end facing the viewer, with a visible license plate. It's a sunny day, casting shadows on the road from the worker and equipment.
