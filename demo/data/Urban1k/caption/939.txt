This image features a street scene with a line-up of red double-decker buses on the right side of a two-lane road. The buses display advertisements on their sides. The architecture along the street is consistent with urban European buildings, likely residential or mixed-use, with various window shapes and fa√ßade colors. The sky appears overcast, and the general ambiance suggests an early morning or late afternoon time in a possibly British city. The street itself appears damp, hinting at recent rain, and there's a man walking on the pavement to the right, partially obscured by a bus.
