This image shows a modern white coach bus with black and red accents, marked by the logo "BEX," indicating it belongs to a bus service possibly named Berlin Linien Bus. The bus is on a city street, with urban buildings and a street lamp visible in the background. The vehicle has a sleek, curved front with a large windshield affording clear visibility to the driver, who can be seen through the glass. The bus appears to be at a stop, as the driver is looking out the side window, and a passenger seated behind the driver is visible, looking forward. The bus registration plates suggest it is registered in Germany.
