The image captures a sunny day on a city street lined with commercial buildings. A man wearing a white T-shirt and light blue jeans walks on the sidewalk, moving away from the camera, his left arm swinging mid-stride. The sidewalk is bordered by a row of trees providing occasional shade and small, flowering plants at the base. Parked cars are visible on the road with a white sedan closest to the viewer. Large storefront windows reflect the street scene and display colorful merchandise. Above the windows, the architecture suggests a mix of residential and commercial occupancy with brick facades and ornate detailing.
