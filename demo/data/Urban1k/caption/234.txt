This image shows a suburban street scene with a small convenience store called "EASY MARKET" which advertises selling liquor and wine. A classic red, white, and blue Pepsi sign hangs above the store's yellow banner. The store is flanked by other closed storefronts with metal shutters. In front of the market is a sidewalk with a bike locked to a bike rack. The street is quiet with parked cars along the curb and a white pickup truck on the left. There are traffic signs, one indicating a speed limit of 30, and a pedestrian crossing. Trees line the sidewalks, and the sky is clear.
