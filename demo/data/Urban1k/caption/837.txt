A bright yellow train with a white front stands on a railway track at a rural station during daylight. The train seems modern with a curved front design, and it bears a logo near its center. Beside the active track on which the train rests, there is an additional track overgrown with grass, hinting at low usage. The station platform runs parallel to the train, with a weathered, low concrete edge. A small, possibly old station building with grey roofing and rough, faded walls is visible at the platform. There is lush greenery surrounding the scene, with trees and bushes under a partly cloudy sky.
