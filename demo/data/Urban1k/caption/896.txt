This is an urban street scene during the daytime with clear skies. In the foreground, there's a yellow fire hydrant to the right, with a stop sign above it. On the left, there's a street name sign that reads "AVE. 66" and below it a traffic sign indicating no left turn for vehicles over 3 tons. There is also a metal pole in the center without any sign. The middle ground shows a gray asphalt road with white and yellow traffic markings. Cars are waiting behind a white stop line, and there's additional greenery and trees. In the background, an elevated train is passing on a bridge.
