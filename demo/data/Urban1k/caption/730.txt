The architecture of the station building suggests a traditional European style with red bricks and white-trimmed windows. Overcast skies and bare trees give an impression of late autumn or early winter. The train's design appears dated, indicating it might be an older model in service. The scene is devoid of people, which offers a sense of calm and abandonment. The overall atmosphere is somewhat nostalgic with a sense of past bustling activity now quieted. The railway tracks extend into the distance, emphasizing the length of the train.
