This image captures a white city bus with some beige and blue accents on the side, marked with the number 2647 and equipped with a bicycle rack at the front containing one bicycle. The bus is on a street next to a sidewalk that borders a large, imposing stone building with classical architecture featuring prominent cornices and large windows. There are cars parked along the curb, and a silver sedan appears mid-turn behind the bus. A clear blue sky suggests a sunny day. There's a billboard advertisement mounted on a truck in the background, and the scene suggests an urban, possibly downtown, environment.
