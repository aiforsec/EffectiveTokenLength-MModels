The image captures a busy bus terminal under a clear blue sky, where three bright lime green buses are parked side by side, facing slightly left of the frame. Each bus displays a design with an incorporation of dark green and carries distinct branding on the sides. Pedestrians, including children, are visible in the foreground, with some walking towards the buses and others away. The terminal pavement is marked with white lines, possibly indicating parking spaces or pedestrian paths. A two-level structure looms in the background, suggesting an urban setting. The atmosphere is that of calm, organized travel activity in a spacious, open-air terminal.
