A single-decker city bus with a white and green livery is in the foreground, showing the front section and the side facing the camera. The destination display on the bus reads "Gippeswyk Park 14A via Rail Station." The number "14A" is highlighted in white against a black background. The bus's registration plate is visible. To the left, there is a red-brick building with signage of 'Royal Mail,' and one pedestrian is seen walking past. Traffic lights in front of the bus indicate red, and there is another set of lights to the right. The sky is overcast, and the road appears damp, suggesting recent rain.
