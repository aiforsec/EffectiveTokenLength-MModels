This image captures a snow-covered urban street scene during what appears to be the aftermath of a heavy snowfall. A blanket of snow covers the ground, vehicles, and buildings. The street is lined with red and brown brick buildings, and there is a visible street corner with a red building hosting a business with a yellow and orange awning. The traffic lights are red, and there are snow-laden trees and a streetlight. A solitary figure, wearing light-colored winter clothing, trudges through the snowy street, leaving footprints behind. The overcast sky suggests it might still be snowing lightly. Snowdrifts are piled up on the sidewalks and against parked cars that are almost entirely covered with snow, indicating the depth of the snowfall.
