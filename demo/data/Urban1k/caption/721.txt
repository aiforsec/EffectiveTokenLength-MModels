This image displays a group of mounted police officers patrolling a city street. The officers, wearing light blue shirts and darker blue pants, are also donning matching helmets. Their horses come in various colors, including black and brown, with some horses having distinctive white markings on their legs and faces. The surrounding environment is an urban setting with tall commercial buildings flanking either side of the asphalt road. It appears to be a sunny day, and the officers are riding in a formation that suggests organized movement through the streets. A civilian spectator, visible to the right of the frame, watches the procession, partially obstructed from view.
