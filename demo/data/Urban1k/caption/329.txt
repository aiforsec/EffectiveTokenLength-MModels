This is an image of a white delivery truck with blue and red branding parked in a lot with trees and a clear blue sky in the background. The truck is a cab-over-engine style with a medium-length cargo box. The vehicle's branding includes a prominent logo on its side, which is reflective of a popular beverage company. The truck cab has a sun visor over the windshield and amber warning lights on its roof. The driver's side door is visible, and the truck appears to be bearing a California license plate. Shadows on the ground suggest it's a sunny day.
