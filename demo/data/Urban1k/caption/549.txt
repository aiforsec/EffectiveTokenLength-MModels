There's a pedestrian crossing ahead, marked by yellow pedestrian crossing signs on both sides of the street. Overhead, power lines crisscross between utility poles. To the left, residential properties are visible, including a white house with a sloping roof behind a tree. Palm trees are prominent, punctuating the skyline with their distinct shape.
