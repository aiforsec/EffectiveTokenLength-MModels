A yellow public transportation bus with green and orange accents is prominently positioned in the foreground on a sunny day. The bus displays the number "2414" and additional graphics, including the text "Cavite" and "Naic," indicating its route or destination. Positioned on the right is a commercial building advertising a sale, with vehicles parked in its vicinity. The scene is a bustling street with multiple lanes, where a variety of other vehicles, such as a small silver car, a delivery truck, and a tricycle, are visible. Overhead cables stretch across the blue sky. The image is watermarked with "Leonidas Smith1866 2013" at the bottom right.
