This image captures a busy urban street scene dominated by a red OC Transpo articulated city bus in the foreground, servicing the Ottawa area. Behind the bus, vehicular traffic consisting of various cars can be seen waiting at a traffic signal. The street features multiple traffic signs, directing to Sussex and George, as well as obligatory right turn arrows and lane merging indicators. Overhead, traffic lights are suspended on cables across the intersection. On the right, a classic street lamp with spherical fixtures and a tri-lobed base provides pedestrian lighting. Buildings with reflective windows rise in the background, suggesting a downtown commercial area.
