Two motorcyclists are riding down a street, with the nearest rider leading the other. The leading motorcyclist is wearing a pinkish scarf, black jacket, and has a white and black helmet with the visor down. A child is seated behind this rider, facing backwards, wearing a bright red coat. Both riders have their bikes loaded with various items, including luggage on the back. The road appears wide with several lanes and has a few parked vehicles on the right. Trees line the edges of the street and various shop signs can be seen in the background, suggesting an urban setting. The sky is overcast.
