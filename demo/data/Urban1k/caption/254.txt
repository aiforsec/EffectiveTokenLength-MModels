A green and beige city bus is driving on a street adorned with foliage. The bus, with "Non-Step Bus" markings, has digital signage displaying Japanese characters, indicating its route or destination. Behind the bus are multi-story buildings displaying various advertisements and signage, suggesting an urban setting. Visible signs with Japanese text suggest the location could be Japan. The architecture is modern with prominent windows, and there are other vehicles on the road, including a silver car behind the bus. A clear blue sky peeks through between the buildings, and the overall lighting conditions suggest daytime.
