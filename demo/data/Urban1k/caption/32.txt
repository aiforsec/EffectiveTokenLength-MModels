The image depicts a busy urban street scene with two double-decker buses. The bus in the foreground is orange with a destination sign on the top that says "Woodley" and displays the route number 13. It has advertisements on its side. Nearby, passengers are boarding, and one individual is speaking to the driver. The bus in the background is cream and brown with advertisements on its rear. There are modern and older brick buildings around, suggesting a mixed urban environment. Green foliage from a tree is visible on the right, contributing to a sense of an urban space with some greenery. The sky is slightly overcast with soft, diffuse light.
