This image captures a roadwork site under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds. A portable orange traffic signal mounted on an extendable arm is located on the right side of a two-lane road, indicating a work zone. There is a series of orange and white traffic barrels aligned along the road, marking the boundary of the construction area. In the background, a green road sign is partially visible, and the landscape consists of rolling grassy plains with no significant vegetation. The infrastructure appears to signal a stoppage or rerouting of traffic on this rural roadway.
