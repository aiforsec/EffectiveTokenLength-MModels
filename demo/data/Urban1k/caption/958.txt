This image shows a double-decker bus parked on a city street in daylight. The bus has a mostly white body with red and blue horizontal stripes along its side and an advertisement in black text on a white background. It appears to be a public transport vehicle as denoted by the sign "Travel West Midlands." Behind it, there is a pedestrian walkway with a few people walking, and a modern building facade with reflective glass windows, a large arch above the entrance, and a tree to the left foreground. The weather seems to be clear as daylight is bright and visibility is high.
