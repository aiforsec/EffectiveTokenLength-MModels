The image depicts a narrow city street flanked by buildings with predominantly beige facades. On the left, there is a sidewalk lined with metal bollards, behind which a person is sitting. Various vehicles, including cars and motorcycles, are parked along the curbside. A red car is prominently parked on the right, with bicycles locked to a rack nearby. In the mid-distance, a man appears to be walking into the street. The street is bathed in the warm hues of early evening or morning light, and there are indications of commercial activity such as a green pharmacy sign.
