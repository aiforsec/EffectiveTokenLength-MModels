This image is taken from the inside of a bus, looking out onto a city street through the front windshield. The bus number plate reads "2207". A rearview mirror is mounted at the upper right corner of the windshield, reflecting the interior of the bus. Through the windshield, traffic lights are visible; one is red, indicating a stop signal. There are parked cars along the side of the road and various business signs in the background, including one that advertises a car wash with a price of $3.95. A bright, clear sky suggests it's daytime, and the angle of the sunlight indicates either morning or late afternoon light.
