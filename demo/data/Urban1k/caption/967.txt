This is a black and white photograph featuring two large elephants walking down a wet urban street, away from the camera. Each elephant's skin is textured and has a visible wrinkling. There are buildings with storefronts on the left side, and on the right, the street extends into the distance where pedestrians and cyclists are seen. The image captures a contrast between the calm, massive presence of the elephants and the everyday hustle of the city street. The perspective emphasizes the elephants' size compared to the surrounding environment.
