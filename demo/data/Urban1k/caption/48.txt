The image captures an urban winter scene with a blanket of snow covering the ground and street fixtures. A traffic light in the foreground displays a green signal, partially obscured by snow that has settled on its casings. Behind the light, a pedestrian crosses the road, dressed in cold-weather clothing. Construction or roadwork barriers with red and white markings partition off an area in the middle of the frame. Behind those barriers, a tall crane looms in the hazy, overcast sky. Snow-dusted buildings and a variety of signage add to the busy feel of the street scene. Snowfall appears recent, accumulating on surfaces and contributing to a muted palette of whites, grays, and urban tones.
