The image depicts a vintage red and white bus with "ISMAEL BUS LINE" written on its side, parked on a street alongside a classic olive-green Jeep. The bus has the number "402" prominently displayed on its front and side. It has a weathered look with visible rust and faded paint, indicating its age and use. A two-story building with multiple shuttered windows and external stairs can be seen in the background, suggesting an urban setting. The vehicles are parked on asphalt, and the scene has a calm atmosphere without any visible pedestrians. The light appears soft, which could indicate early morning or late afternoon.
