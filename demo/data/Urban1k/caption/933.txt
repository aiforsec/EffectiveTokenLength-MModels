The image shows a daytime scene at an intersection with multiple lanes on a paved road. There are two cars stopped at the intersection: the nearest is a dark grey sedan with its brake lights on, and the next is a white car. The traffic lights are visible overhead and all display red, indicating a stop signal for the vehicles. In the background, there are several other cars and some traffic cones indicating possible roadwork or lane closures. Behind the scene, lush green trees line the road and a mountain or large hill can be seen in the distance under a clear blue sky.
