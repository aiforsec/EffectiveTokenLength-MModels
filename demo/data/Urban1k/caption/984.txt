In the image, a woman is riding a blue motor scooter on a street, holding an umbrella open above her head. She is wearing a red shirt, a pink helmet, and a face mask. Behind her is another rider on a red motor scooter. To the right side of the photograph, there is a parked white pickup truck with its rear towards the camera. The setting appears to be a sunny day with clear skies, and the surroundings suggest a suburban area with trees and traditional structures along the road. There are also two people sitting down in the shade to the left, behind a blue roadside barrier.
