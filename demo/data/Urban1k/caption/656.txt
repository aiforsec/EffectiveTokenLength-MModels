A blue and white tram labeled '9 Luchthaven Schip' travels along tram rails on a street lined with various commercial establishments, including recognizable fast-food chains. Overhead, an intricate network of tram power lines crisscrosses the sky. Dominating the background is an ornate clock tower with a weather vane, standing as part of an older, historic building. The street is busy with pedestrians, and the day appears overcast, as evidenced by the gray skies and the lighting in the scene. To the right side, large vertical neon signs add a commercial vibe to the urban setting.
