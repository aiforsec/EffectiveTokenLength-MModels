A red and white bus is visible in an urban environment with a colorful advertisement wrapped around its rear. The ad features cute, stylized graphics, including birds and a ladybug. There are two pedestrians walking past the bus: one carrying a bag and the other holding a mobile phone. The setting includes a pedestrianized street with a storefront bearing signage and a no entry sign for vehicles pointing towards the right. Above, the sky is partly cloudy. The bus registration plate is visible, and it indicates a Hampshire County Council connection, hinting at the location within the United Kingdom.
