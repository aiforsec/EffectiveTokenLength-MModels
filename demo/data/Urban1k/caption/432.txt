A cyclist in a blue jacket and jeans rides a red bicycle across a street, glancing to the left at a jogging woman in a white top and black leggings, who is accompanied by a small grey and white dog on a leash. The setting is an urban street lined with parked cars and brick buildings. It's overcast, and the street is marked with white pedestrian crossing lines. The scene captures daily urban life, suggesting a cool weather due to the attire of the individuals. The dog appears to be a small to medium breed, possibly a pug or a bulldog mix, wearing a harness.
