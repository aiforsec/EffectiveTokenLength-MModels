This image shows a snowy bus terminal scene with multiple buses and pedestrians. In the foreground, a blue bus with the number 5 marked on its digital sign is stopped, reflecting the wet pavement. Commuters, some holding umbrellas, cross the bus lane, wearing winter clothing to shield against the snowfall that's visibly coming down. In the background, other parked buses and a bus shelter with waiting passengers can be seen. Beyond the immediate vicinity, large cranes and the early stages of buildings under construction emerge through the descending snow. The sky is overcast, and the ambiance suggests a cold, urban winter day.
