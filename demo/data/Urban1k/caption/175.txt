Two mounted police officers on brown horses are positioned in front of a historic building with ornate architecture, including archways and decorative details. The officers wear navy blue uniforms with white helmets. Onlookers, some casually dressed and others in warmer attire, suggest diverse weather conditions. The environment is a well-maintained urban square with cobblestone paving. In the background are intricately designed buildings with gold trim and statues, indicative of a European city rich in cultural heritage. The scene has a peaceful atmosphere with the public seemingly at ease around the police presence.
