The image shows a street scene with two double-decker buses: one red and one blue. The red bus in the foreground bears the logo of 'Stagecoach' and a sign indicating 'Rail Replacement Service.' Behind it, a blue bus with 'Ensign' written on it is parked. Both buses seem to be at a bus stop where a few passengers are waiting. A man in a high-visibility vest talks to the driver of the red bus. In the background, there's an urban environment with trees, a fence, and a peculiar red tower structure. The sky is cloudy, suggesting overcast weather.
