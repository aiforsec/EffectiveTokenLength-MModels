Two road workers wearing high-visibility jackets are on a city street, with one standing beside a truck equipped with road work signage and the other kneeling on the crosswalk. The truck has yellow and red stripes, a warning sign depicting a person at work, and alphanumeric codes. There's urban architecture in the background, including red brick and contemporary buildings, with a distinctive oval-shaped sculpture mounted on a pillar. Trees with autumn foliage and clear blue skies suggest a sunny day. Road signs, pedestrian signals, and street markings are visible under the soft shadows cast by the early or late daylight.
