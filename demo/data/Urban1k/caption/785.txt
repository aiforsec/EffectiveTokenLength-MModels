The image captures a crowd of people, many wearing hats, gathered in front of an ornate, medieval astronomical clock attached to a gothic-style building with a spire and arched windows. The clock features multiple dials, with the main one having Roman numerals and zodiac signs. Above the main dial is a smaller golden clock with symbols, and there are intricate details and embellishments around these dials. The surrounding architecture includes a mix of colored walls, ranging from beige to muted orange, with contrasting dark stone work around the clock and windows. The sky appears overcast.
