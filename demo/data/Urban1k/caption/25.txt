An orange public transit bus is prominently positioned in the foreground, featuring a mounted bicycle on the front rack, driving along a sunny, tree-lined street. The bus route sign reads "40U SHORT LINE." An array of retail and commercial buildings flank the left side of the street, displaying various signage. Vehicles are parked along the curb, and a red car is visible on the road, following the bus. Palms and other lush trees punctuate the skyline, while puffy white clouds are interspersed in the bright blue sky above. Typical urban infrastructure, including traffic signs and street lamps, completes the scene.
