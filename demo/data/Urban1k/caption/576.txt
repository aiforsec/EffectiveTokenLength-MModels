A dark-colored sedan is parked askew on the side of a street, half on the asphalt road and half on the concrete sidewalk. Patches of melting snow are present, indicating recent snowfall or wintry conditions. In the background, a white sedan is parked correctly on the opposite side of the street. Residential buildings with white fences, bare deciduous trees, and other parked cars line the street. There's a general sense of a suburban or residential neighborhood on a clear day with sunlight casting shadows on the ground. Visible tire tracks through the snow suggest recent vehicle movement.
