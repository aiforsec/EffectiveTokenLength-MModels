This image is a double exposure photograph blending two different street scenes. In the foreground, a nearly empty sidewalk lined with tall palm trees and lush greenery runs parallel to a road. A bus with the destination sign illuminated approaches on the street, giving the impression of either early morning or late afternoon service due to the soft, warm light that pervades the scene. The ghostly overlay of the second scene introduces additional elements such as street signs and extra foliage, which intersperse with clouds in the sky, casting a dreamy, surreal atmosphere over the urban landscape. The dominant colors are greens, blues, yellows, and hints of orange, reflecting a vibrant, yet tranquil urban setting.
