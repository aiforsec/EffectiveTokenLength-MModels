The image portrays a group of individuals on a rain-soaked street. In the foreground, a couple shares a dark umbrella, the woman wearing a light jacket and jeans, the man in dark clothing. Nearby, two women stand under separate umbrellas, one blue and one patterned with flowers. Both clad in dark attire, with one sporting vibrant pink and purple rain boots. The wet pavement reflects their silhouettes and the lights around. In the background, cars and a delivery truck provide context to an urban setting, hinting at a bustling city despite the dreary weather conditions.
