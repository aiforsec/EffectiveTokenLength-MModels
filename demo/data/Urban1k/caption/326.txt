The image shows a two-story public bus painted in bright red with yellow accents, operating in Brighton & Hove as denoted by the inscription on its side. The bus is positioned on an urban street with a slight curve to the left. Behind the bus, we see a row of commercial buildings with a variety of storefronts, including "First Sport," with pedestrians walking and sitting in front. The sky is partly cloudy with ample daylight illuminating the setting. The architecture of the buildings is typical of British towns with a mix of modern and traditional facades.
