This image features a teal and blue-colored city bus driving on an urban road. The bus is adorned with the word 'Qliner' on the side, indicating the service or brand it's operating under. Behind the bus, to its left, is a grayish-blue hatchback car stopped at the junction. In the background, construction or maintenance work is evident, with elements of scaffolding against a partly visible white building with red elements. Road markings, including a bike lane symbol and directional arrows for lanes, are clearly painted in white on the asphalt. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting it's a bright day with some clouds.
