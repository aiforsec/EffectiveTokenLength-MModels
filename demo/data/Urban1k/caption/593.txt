This image shows a view of a highway with multiple lanes filled with vehicles. In the foreground, there's the rear of a white San Mateo County Transit District bus, marked with the number 108. To the left of the bus, another bus with a cream and orange color scheme is partially visible. The vehicles appear to be in a queue, suggesting traffic congestion. In the far background, a skyline of a city with several high-rise buildings can be seen under a clear blue sky. The highway has yellow lane markings, and there's a concrete barrier to the right of the buses.
