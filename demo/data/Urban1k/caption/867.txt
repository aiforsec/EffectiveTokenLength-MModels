A man wearing a baseball cap, a dark sleeveless shirt, and khaki shorts is standing on a crosswalk, straddling a bicycle. He is holding onto the handlebars and appears to look to his side while waiting. A large black dog with a brown underbelly, possibly a Rottweiler, is walking beside him, attached to the bike with a leash or specialized harness. The bicycle has a set of panniers on the rear rack. The setting is an urban intersection with multiple traffic lights hanging overhead, all displaying red lights. Sky is overcast, and cars in the distance wait at the intersection. The street name 'EST AV' is visible on a road sign.
