This image captures an urban street scene dominated by a traffic signal pole at the center. Affixed to the pole are various signs: a digital crosswalk signal indicating a red hand with a countdown of "3" seconds, a street name sign for "2nd Ave" with a green background and white lettering, and a "ONE WAY" sign with a directional arrow pointing to the right. In the background, there's a blue and yellow sign that advertises "Breakfast All Day" above a restaurant entrance. In the foreground, pedestrians appear to be walking along the sidewalk, and a set of traffic lights is partially visible at the top right corner. The location looks like a bustling downtown area with ample sunshine.
