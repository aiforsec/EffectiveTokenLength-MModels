This image captures a cloudy day at an urban intersection with overcast skies. Pedestrians are seen in various kinds of attire; one person on the left holds an umbrella, suggesting recent or impending rain. A delineated crosswalk is visible in the foreground, featuring tactile paving for visually impaired pedestrians. Multiple traffic signals and a pole with attached signs, one of which has yellow coloring, are centrally positioned. Vehicles, including a green public bus and several cars, are stopped or in motion on the wet street. Trees with sparse foliage and a few buildings provide a backdrop, indicating a cooler season.
