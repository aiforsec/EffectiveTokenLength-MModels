The image depicts a serene canal lined with traditional European architecture under a partially cloudy blue sky. On both sides of the canal, 4 to 5-story buildings with gabled roofs occupy the frame, exhibiting a variety of earthy and pastel facades. Numerous windows and some visible balconies enhance the residential feel, while lush green trees sporadically dot the sidewalks, complementing potted red flowers on a balcony. Observed are parked cars and bicycles, typical urban transportation options. On the water, a rowing team in a slender white boat with multiple rowers in sync is trailing a motorized boat adorned with a Dutch flag. A stationary boat named "BATON MK" with weathered green paint is moored on the right, adding to the city's charming maritime atmosphere.
