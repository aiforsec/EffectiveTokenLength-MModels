The image shows a street scene on a foggy day with limited visibility. On the left, there's a double-decker bus showing advertisements, painted in bright teal. In the middle of the image, cars with their headlights on approach along the road. A pedestrian, wearing dark clothing, walks on the sidewalk to the right, heading away from the viewer. Streetlights are visible but appear dim due to the fog. The sky is overcast, blending with the fog, casting an overall bluish-grey hue over the scene. The atmosphere is quiet and the weather conditions suggest early morning or late evening with lower levels of activity.
