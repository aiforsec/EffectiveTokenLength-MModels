This image depicts a white police SUV with black and yellow detailing parked on an urban street. The vehicle has the word "POLICE" prominently displayed on its side and rear, along with a badge emblem and a phone number. The SUV is marked with a unit number "1007" and has its red and blue emergency lights on the roof activated. Behind the vehicle, there is a bus painted with the word "all around" moving on the street, and we can also see a series of recycling bins lined up near the sidewalk. The street signs indicate "One Way" and "No Turn on Red" at the intersection of Forbes Ave, with a traffic light showing red. The environment appears overcast, and buildings typical of a downtown area form the background.
