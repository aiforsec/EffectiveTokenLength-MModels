This image captures a group of people participating in a road race on a large bridge under a clear blue sky. The perspective is from the middle of the road, looking towards the towering structure of the bridge with its distinctive suspension cables and tall pillars painted in a light blue color, which contrasts with the sky. Runners are dressed in various colors and are spread out across the lanes, some closer to the camera and others off in the distance. Discarded clothing articles in varied colors are scattered along the central yellow dividing line of the road, suggesting that the participants shed layers after warming up during the race. In the foreground, a road sign restricting the passage of pedestrians is visible, being somewhat ironic given the event taking place. The overall mood of the scene is active and vibrant, typical of a public sporting event.
