The image depicts a sunny day on a busy street, where a traditional horse-drawn cart occupies the foreground. The cart, which appears blue and white, carries at least two passengers and is pulled by a single brown horse outfitted with a harness. To the right, a person rides a bicycle, wearing a white shirt and tan pants. Slightly to the left background, a group of people waits, possibly at a bus stop, with a vintage red car parked nearby. Behind them, a single-story building with a red roof and white walls suggests a commercial structure with glass-fronted entrances and a palm tree to the far left.
