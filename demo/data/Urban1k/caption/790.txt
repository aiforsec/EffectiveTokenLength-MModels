A white public transportation bus is on a city street with "PILACAO" printed along the side, featuring black and blue graphics on its exterior. The bus has a modern design with a curved windshield and appears to be in motion. Behind it, commercial buildings, including one with a large sale banner, are visible. A compact red car is parked on the side of the road farther back. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and the road has multiple lanes, suggesting an urban setting. A watermark indicating the name "Leonidas Smith 1866 2013" is seen in the bottom right corner.
