This image captures an urban street scene at dusk with cars stopped at a traffic light. The sunset's soft glow is visible between buildings at the vanishing point of the street, suggesting the westward direction of the avenue. Vehicles are a mix of sedans and SUVs, with their headlights turned on against the dimming light. Traffic lights show green for the direction facing the viewer. Buildings line both sides of the street, with visible signage and storefronts including a shop named "Running Room." Overhead, electrical wires criss-cross above, and taller buildings, likely residential, loom in the background.
