This image captures an urban street scene with multiple elements. On the left, an orange city bus is traveling on a road alongside a pavement where pedestrians are walking. A traffic light and a metal barrier can be seen. In the foreground, three individuals are present: one appears to be crossing the road, another is standing on the sidewalk potentially waiting, and the third individual is walking away from the camera. On the right, there's a blue double-decker bus on the incoming lane. Various models and colors of cars are dispersed throughout the scene, with a black SUV crossing the frame's center. Trees and a parking lot with cars are noticeable in the background. The setting is likely in a developed country, given the infrastructure and vehicle types.
