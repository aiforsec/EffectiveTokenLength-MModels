This image captures a night scene of an urban street. A white public transport bus with blue and red stripes is in motion, likely making a turn, with its headlights and interior lighting visible. The bus has a front-facing door, and multiple windows run the length of its sides. The streets are illuminated by the glow of street lamps and building lights. Traffic signals are present, with at least one red light indicating a stop signal. To the right, there's a structure resembling part of a bridge or overpass with lights underneath. The buildings flanking the street have a classical architectural style with rows of evenly spaced windows. Some motion blur suggests the photo was taken with a slower shutter speed or while moving.
