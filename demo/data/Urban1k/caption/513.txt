The image captures a busy urban scene with public transport vehicles. In the foreground, a yellow and red tram with the number "9N" is moving on its tracks. Parallel to the tram, there's a yellow and red city bus parked on the roadside, displaying the number "2634" on its side. Traffic signs and a bus stop sign with the letter "F" on it are visible. Overhead are electric cables possibly for the tram system. In the background, a towering structure with a clock is prominent, behind which multi-storey buildings with colorful facades are visible. A hazy sky suggests either a misty morning or air pollution, and hints of snow can be seen on the ground.
