This is a street scene featuring a collection of traffic signs mounted on a single post at the edge of a sidewalk. At the top, there's a one-way sign pointing left, followed by a large yellow diamond-shaped sign depicting a bicycle above an "RXR" symbol, indicating a bike route crossing railroad tracks. Below it, there are two rectangular signs; the upper sign is an additional warning that says "USE EXTREME CAUTION," with the bottom sign being a regulatory "NO PARKING ANY TIME" notice. In the background, you can see part of a high-rise building, a tree, a clear road and bike lane, and another building across the street.
