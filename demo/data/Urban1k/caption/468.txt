This image shows a modified stop sign with an added word to make a humorous phrase. The sign is octagonal and red with white lettering that is meant to read "STOP," but an additional word "POOPING" has been appended below, altering the sign's message. The sign is mounted on a metal post with visible bolts and holes. Behind the sign is a parking lot with various parked cars and a shopping cart corral with red carts. In the background, there's a building with visible signage indicating it's a Best Buy store. Trees without leaves suggest it might be in a colder season or a region where trees are deciduous.
