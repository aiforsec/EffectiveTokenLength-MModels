A person with a backpack is standing next to a utility pole covered in layers of tattered and torn posters at an urban street corner. A red streetcar is visible in the background, suggesting a public transit system in a city. The traffic light overhead displays a red signal, indicating a stop for vehicles along the street lined with bare trees, indicative of a winter or early spring season. A visible sign warns of a fine for posting, with a monetary amount displayed prominently, and features both English and Chinese text, suggesting a multicultural area. The overcast sky suggests a gloomy or cold day.
