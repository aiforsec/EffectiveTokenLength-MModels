A single-decker blue and white city bus is parked at a roadside bus stop on a sunny winter day. The ground and surrounding landscape are covered with snow, with the exception of the cleared asphalt road. There are several passengers waiting: three people stand next to the bus, while others are seated on the benches inside a sheltered waiting area. Bare trees and a large building with multiple windows can be seen in the background. The bus has a destination sign on the front, and there's a road marking indicating a bus stop.
