A yellow double-decker tourist bus with an open top is centered in the image; passengers are visible on the upper deck. The bus is on an urban street with cars and a taxi in the foreground that is moving in the opposite direction. Traffic lights are on red above the bus. The scene suggests a bustling city environment with wide roads, lined by European-style buildings and tall trees. A green 'Subte' sign indicates the presence of a subway station entry. The overcast sky suggests it might be either early morning or overcast weather. The bus displays signage indicating it's part of a Buenos Aires tour service.
