In this urban scene, an individual with a dark coat and trousers holds a blue umbrella while briskly crossing the street, parallel to a stationary vehicle that displays a taxi light on its roof. The traffic signal at the near corner exhibits a green light. Rain is visibly descending, gleaming off the wet pavement and creating reflections of city lights. In the background, shop fronts display various signage, including one that reads "MUNCHIES," advertising hot and cold filled rolls. The environment appears overcast, and the people in the background also carry umbrellas, suggesting an inclement weather setting. Bright yellow lines on the road mark parking restrictions or traffic lanes.
