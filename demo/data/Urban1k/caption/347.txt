This image captures a busy street corner on a sunny day with a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a red octagonal stop sign is prominently affixed to a grey metal pole on the right side. Behind the stop sign, the intersection is bustling with vehicles including white vans, a silver sedan, and a white car in motion. A beige corner building with a curved facade features two levels, decorated with green signage and windows; it appears to be a pub or bar given the visual cues. Pedestrians are seen walking on the sidewalk, and a red pedestrian signal light is visible above the corner building. A traffic light is installed above the intersection.
