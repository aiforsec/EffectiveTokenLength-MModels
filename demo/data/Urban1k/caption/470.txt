This image depicts a daytime street scene with vehicles and people. On the left, there is a dark grey or black car parked on a curb near a pharmacy with a green cross sign. Three individuals, likely women, are standing close to the vehicle having a conversation. Behind them, an older couple appears to be walking past a shop window. On the right of the scene, a person is seated in a light blue or silver car, gazing out of the open driver's side window. Road signs indicating no entry are visible in the background, hanging from a traffic light post above the street. Trees line the sidewalk, partially obscuring the buildings and signs.
