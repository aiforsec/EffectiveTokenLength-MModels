This image captures a street corner with a vibrant yellow building on the left and a tree-lined road on the right. The focal point is a street sign for Melrose Avenue, which is heavily adorned with a variety of stickers featuring different logos, cartoons, and artistic designs. The sign, affixed to a metal pole, is positioned at an angle and partially obscures the clear blue sky. The scene is quiet with parked cars lining the side of the road and a pedestrian visible in the distance. Electrical cables can be seen extending across the upper portion of the image.
