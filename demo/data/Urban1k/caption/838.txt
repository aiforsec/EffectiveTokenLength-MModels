The image depicts a street scene where a group of people is participating in a demonstration. The protesters are carrying banners and signs, some of which are green and white with messages about jobs and coal mines. The crowd is a mix of ages and appears to be fairly dense, with many participants wearing red. Some people are carrying large banners, while others have smaller placards. The setting is an urban street with trees and a mix of modern and older-style buildings. It's a sunny day casting sharp shadows, indicating either morning or afternoon. There's a sign indicating "Nurses Walk" to the left. The foreground shows individuals not associated with the protest walking by or observing the scene.
