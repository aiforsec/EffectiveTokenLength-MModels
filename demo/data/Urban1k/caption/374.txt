This image shows a lime green public transport bus labeled "22A" serving Friar Street, in the middle of a street with buildings and parked cars to the side. The bus has a destination sign indicating its route and is parked at a bus stop where passengers are boarding. There are several people standing by the bus's front door as they enter, suggesting an urban environment with public transportation services. The scene is set against a clear sky, and the surrounding suggests a reasonably calm traffic day. Behind the green bus, there's another bus partially visible, with a mostly white front.
