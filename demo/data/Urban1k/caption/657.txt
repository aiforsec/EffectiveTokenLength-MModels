This image captures a daytime scene on a multiple-lane highway with vehicles: a red older model convertible sports car is visible in the left lane, and other modern cars are driving and merging in different lanes. Overhead green traffic signs show directions for drivers: the left sign indicates North 687 and 4th Street N with a left arrow, the middle sign points to East 92 towards Tampa with a down arrow, and the rightmost sign directs to West 92 and 4th Street N with a right arrow. The sky is partly cloudy with blue patches, and trees and traffic lights are visible in the surroundings.
