A red and white bus labeled "BrabantLiner" is making a right turn on an urban street. The bus is depicted in a bright daylight setting. Its destination display indicates it is headed towards "Meerkerk." Passengers are visible through the windows, seated inside the vehicle. White dashed road markings are present on the asphalt, and there is a yield sign symbol painted on the street directly in front of the bus. A silver van is parked on the left side, and there are construction elements, such as blue guardrails and scaffolding, in the background. Skyscrapers peek into the sky in the far end, suggesting an urban environment.
