This image shows two articulated buses parked on the side of a wide street, lined by lush green trees. The buses are predominantly white, with aqua blue and hints of dark blue along the lower sides and rears. Each bus features advertisements in contrasting colors on their sides. The lead bus displays a red advertisement, while the trailing bus has a purple one. An empty sidewalk is visible beside the stationary buses, and there's a well-maintained grass verge separating the sidewalk from the tree line. The buses appear to be in good condition under clear, bright daylight.
