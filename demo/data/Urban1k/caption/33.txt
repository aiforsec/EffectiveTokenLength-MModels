This image features a double-decker bus prominently in the foreground, painted in a cream and maroon livery with "Brighton & Hove" branding. Its destination display reads "Brighton 29A." The setting appears to be a sunny day on a quiet, narrow urban street lined with a mix of residential and commercial buildings, typical of a British town. In the background, you can see the facades of houses and small shops with traditional architecture, including brick and stucco walls, and tiled roofs. Several parked cars, including a red and black one, are visible on the right side of the street. The street is paved with asphalt, and there's a sidewalk on both sides, bordered by curb stones.
