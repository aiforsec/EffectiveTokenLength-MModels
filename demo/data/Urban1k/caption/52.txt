A red and white city bus is at the forefront of an urban street scene, with the route number 17 "PARKMERCED LOOP" displayed on its marquee. A man in a white shirt and black pants appears to be walking in front of the bus, crossing the street. The background is busy with several vehicles, including a silver car in the immediate foreground. An overcast sky suggests a gloomy day. A bus shelter with an orange roof is visible in the background to the right. Green foliage peeks from behind the shelter, indicating nearby vegetation, possibly a park or landscaped area.
