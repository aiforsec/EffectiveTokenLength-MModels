You are looking at a white coach bus with the word "TRAFALGAR" printed in red on its side, positioned in a city environment. The bus has a distinctive, bold stripe in multiple colors—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple—descending diagonally from the top to the bottom of the vehicle. Behind the colorful stripe, a URL "www.trafalgar.com" is visible. A taxi sign, attached to a pole with a red circle and line crossing a word "TAXI," indicating a taxi stand, is in the foreground, partially obscuring the view of the bus. There are other vehicles in the background, including a glimpse of a blue tour bus and a black car on the street.
