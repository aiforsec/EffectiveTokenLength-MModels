The image depicts an urban street scene with an old red-brown upright piano discarded on the sidewalk. A black dog is sniffing around the base of the piano, which is near a traditional fire hydrant and several black garbage bags piled adjacent to the piano. The background shows the facade of red-brick buildings, leafless trees, parked cars, including a silver SUV, and the early evening sky. The atmosphere suggests a quiet residential area, possibly with a chill in the air given the bare trees and the absence of people. The location seems well-tended yet the presence of the abandoned piano provides a contrast to the orderly environment.
