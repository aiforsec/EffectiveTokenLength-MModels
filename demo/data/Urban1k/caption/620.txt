The image captures a blue and white city bus in the foreground, labeled "School Special" on the route display, servicing route 824. It is a sunny day and shadows are cast on the street. The bus bears the number 3560 and is branded as "Operated by" a company name, partially visible. In the background are a series of buildings, possibly shops, with a "Post" mailbox prominently displayed at the curb. There's a bus shelter adjacent to the bus, and a leafless tree stands in front of a multi-story building with an array of white balconies. A clear sky is visible between the branches.
