The image displays a fleet of red and white articulated trolleybuses parked in neat rows in an outdoor depot during dusk. In the foreground, one trolleybus is facing the camera and seems to be in operation with illuminated headlights. Above, a complex network of overhead electrical wires, required to power the trolleybuses, crisscrosses the sky. Trees and poles are interspersed between the wires. The lighting suggests early evening with the remnants of a sunset visible on the horizon, giving the sky a gradient from blue to a warm peach hue towards the skyline where buildings can be faintly seen. The overall ambience is calm and still, characteristic of a transit hub outside of active service hours.
