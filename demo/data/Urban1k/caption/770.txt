This image depicts an ornate salmon-pink building with green copper-domed towers during the early evening or dusk. The architecture suggests a historical or possibly Baroque influence. Illuminated red neon signs are visible on the facade: one resembling a number and the other a symbol. In the foreground, the streaks of red and white lights indicate the motion blur of a vehicle captured in long exposure, suggesting a bustling city atmosphere. The sky is dim, conveying that it is either dawn or sunset, adding a moody contrast to the bright artificial lights. No people are visible, and foliage is barely discernible in the low light.
