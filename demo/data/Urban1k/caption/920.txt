The image depicts a suburban street lined with houses and parked cars on a sunny day with patches of snow on the ground. On the left, three multi-story attached houses with similar architectural designs are visible; the first is painted yellow and the next two are beige. To the right stands a detached blue house featuring a porch with a white railing. All houses have various window configurations and pitched roofs. There are four vehicles parked in front of the houses: two are sedans, one appears to be a hatchback, and the fourth is partially visible. A person stands on the sidewalk near the porch of one house, while another person carries bags towards the blue car parked on the street.
