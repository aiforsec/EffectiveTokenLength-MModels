This image shows a sunny day on a city bridge with people and vehicles. A couple walks towards the camera on a sidewalk, accompanied by a black dog on a leash. The woman wears white shorts and a light top, while the man sports a black t-shirt and shorts. A red, classic-style vehicle drives past on the road to their right. A metal barrier separates the pedestrian path from the road. Beyond the bridge, a cityscape with various buildings under a clear blue sky is visible. A light pole on the sidewalk is covered with stickers and graffiti. The river under the bridge reflects the buildings and sky above.
