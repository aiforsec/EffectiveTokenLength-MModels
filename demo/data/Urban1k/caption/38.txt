This image captures an urban evening scene with a commercial airplane flying low over a cityscape during sunset. The foreground shows a busy street scene with pedestrians crossing the road and stationary vehicles, including white and green buses and a white mini-van. The background is dominated by a tall modern building with a blue and beige facade, featuring the signage "Parkson" on it. Smaller buildings with reflective windows are also visible. The sky has a gradient of warm hues, transitioning from yellow near the horizon to a darker blue above, hinting at dusk. The overall atmosphere combines the bustle of city life with the proximity of an airport.
