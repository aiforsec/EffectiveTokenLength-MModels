In this urban setting on a wet day, a person with a greenish bike is in the foreground, pedaling bare-chested with a backwards baseball cap. There's a wet sheen on the road reflecting the overcast sky, and pedestrians with umbrellas are behind the cyclist. A man wearing a white shirt walks briskly looking to his left. Another individual in a blue jacket and baseball cap walks towards the right, under a beige umbrella. A cyclist in a yellow jacket is in the background. Parked cars line the road, and red-brick buildings form the backdrop. The traffic signal on the right corner is red, and a red street box is visible.
