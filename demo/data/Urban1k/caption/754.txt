A group of cyclists is engaged in a road race on a suburban street. The lead cyclist, wearing a green and black kit, is slightly ahead and in focus, while the pursuing peloton appears in the distance, moving around a bend in the road. Spectators line the street on both sides, with some close to the foreground on the left edge of the frame. The scenery is punctuated by buildings with pale exteriors, greenery and a prominent no entry sign to the right. The weather seems overcast, casting a diffuse light over the entire scene, with no harsh shadows visible.
