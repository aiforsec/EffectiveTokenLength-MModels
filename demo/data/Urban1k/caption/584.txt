This image features a classic red double-decker bus being towed by a green vintage tow truck. The bus, which appears to be a mid-20th-century British model, has advertisements on its side. The tow truck is equipped with a lifting crane, painted green with details in red, and has a winch and hook visible at the rear end. The setting seems to be an outdoor space, perhaps a parking lot, with people in the background, some walking and others standing. The sky is blue with a few clouds, suggesting it is a clear day. There are trees and other vehicles in the distant background.
