This image captures an overcast day with a crowd, many holding umbrellas, gathered on a city street to celebrate a victory event. In the center, an open-top double-decker bus with banners commemorating the "WIGAN WARRIORS 2010 GRAND FINAL WINNERS" is visible, with people on the bus actively engaging with the crowd. The architecture hints at a European town with traditional buildings, including one with a half-timbered fa√ßade. Advertisement banners with a website address are draped over the side of the bus. Despite the rainy weather indicated by the umbrellas, the atmosphere appears joyous, with the attendees' focus on the bus and its passengers.
