A red and white San Francisco Fire Department firetruck is parked on a city street, with "T3" marked on its side and rear, indicating it is a truck from Station 3. The truck, labeled as part of the Aerial Truck Company, is equipped with a long, mounted extendable ladder. Multistory buildings flank the street, featuring signs for automotive service and a business named "Grass Roots." There is a sign that reads "Right Lane Buses Taxis," and a yellow traffic sign indicating the allowed use of the full lane. The environment appears urban and the street is marked with white traffic lines and symbols.
