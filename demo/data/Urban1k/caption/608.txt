The image captures a busy urban street scene with two white articulated trolleybuses, featuring blue and red stripes, connected to overhead wires. Above the buses, a streetlight with a dual-globe design is visible. In the foreground, a pole topped with a flying eagle statue anchors the composition. Behind the buses, several red and white cars are parked. The backdrop is lined with multistory buildings hosting various stores with visible signage. Pedestrians can be seen walking along the sidewalks, and traffic lights are located at the street's intersection. The photo, taken from an elevated angle during daylight, shows the street intersecting leftward, with designated lanes for different directions.
