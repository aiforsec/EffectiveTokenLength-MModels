In the image, a bustling urban street scene features modern high-rise buildings with a mix of reflective glass and concrete facades. The tall structures flank the sides of the photograph, with the one on the right displaying a series of balconies. There is a set of traffic lights showing green signals in the foreground on the right, above a no-left-turn sign. Below, various street signs point left to different locations with distances indicated in kilometers. Part of an overpass or pedestrian crossing with a blue arrow sign is visible in the upper part of the image. The sky is partly cloudy, and there are umbrellas hinting at pedestrians below them, suggesting a busy sidewalk out of the frame.
