A bustling urban street scene amid a heavy snowfall. People, bundled up against the cold, traverse snow-covered sidewalks and pedestrian crossings. The foreground shows individuals in motion, one prominently in a black coat facing away from the viewer. Buildings with European architecture line the street, various shop signs and a large clock face on a building are visible, with the time roughly at 10:10. The color palette is muted with whites and grays dominating due to the wintry weather, accented by the earth tones of the buildings and splashes of color from signage and clothing. Overhead wires, possibly for trams, crisscross above. Snowflakes blur parts of the image, enhancing the wintry atmosphere.
