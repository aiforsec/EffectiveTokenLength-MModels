The image depicts a bustling city square lined with various buildings and filled with pedestrians. A prominent stone building with a facade bearing banners, arched windows, and a tiled lower section stands at the back. This building also features a shaded outdoor seating area possibly associated with a caf√© on the terrace above. Tree foliage emerges from behind structures, and a public bench can be seen occupied by people. The crowd consists of individuals and small groups, casually dressed for warm weather, suggesting a relaxed atmosphere. The square's ground is covered with large tiles, and on the right, a flag protrudes from the architecture.
