A red and white public transit bus displaying the number "7" and "WOLFLINK SHUTTLE" on its electronic header board is passing through a gated entry. The bus number "4278" is visible on its side. The gate arm is raised at a diagonal angle across the frame, with orange traffic cones placed alongside the gate mechanism on the pavement. A man in a dark jacket is standing to the right of the image, seemingly operating or overseeing the gate function. The environment suggests an overcast day, and there are trees and a brick structure visible in the background. A pedestrian with a backpack is also partially visible behind the hedge to the left of the bus.
