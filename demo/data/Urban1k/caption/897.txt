The image shows a traffic signal post at a city intersection during what appears to be dusk or dawn given the level of natural light. Both the pedestrian and bicycle signals are illuminated in green, indicating it is safe to cross or ride through the intersection. The vehicle traffic signals are not lit. A green bicycle silhouette is visible on the bicycle signal. The surroundings include the facades of European-style buildings, street signs, a small billboard with posters, and a distant view of a street lined with parked cars and a few pedestrians. The sky is partly cloudy, casting a soft light on the urban scene.
