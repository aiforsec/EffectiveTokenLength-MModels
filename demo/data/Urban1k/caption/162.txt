This image captures a busy city street lined with high-rise buildings under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a silver electric bus is visible, identifiable by the trolley poles connected to overhead wires. Cars are seen on the road, with the closest being a silver sedan. Traffic lights and street signs are suspended above the road; one sign reads "HYDE GROVE," while the adjacent sign displays "NO TURNS." The architecture of the buildings varies from modern, with reflective glass facades, to older, more ornate structures with stone exteriors. In the distance, a hill dotted with houses and greenery looms behind the urban landscape.
