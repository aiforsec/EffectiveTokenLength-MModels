In the foreground, a cyclist wearing a bright green jacket with reflective elements, black pants, and a white helmet is riding a black bicycle on the street. Behind the cyclist, a large gray tour bus with "BUSARTI-TOURS" on its side is parallel to the cyclist. The bus has the headlights on, indicating it's possibly dawn, dusk, or overcast weather. Further back, there's a white truck with orange markings, labeled "Tarmac" on the side and the manufacturer's logo "MAN." The traffic signal in the background appears red, and the vehicles seem to be waiting or moving slowly. Trees with green foliage and a portion of a building can be seen in the far background, suggesting an urban setting.
