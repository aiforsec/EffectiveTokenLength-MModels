This image captures a quiet urban streetscape with a multi-story residential building dominating the frame. The building features a brown brick facade with balconies, some adorned with plants. To the building's right, there seems to be a small business with a blue sign and an awning. Below the building is an unoccupied space with pillars, likely a parking or commercial area. A couple walks on the zebra crossing, the man in a dark coat and the woman in a black coat with a fur collar. Parked cars line the right side of the street while a pedestrian and a street lamp are visible to the left. The sky appears overcast, suggesting a gloomy day.
