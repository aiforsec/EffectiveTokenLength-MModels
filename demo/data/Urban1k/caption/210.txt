This image shows an urban street scene with a focus on public transportation. On the left, a bright orange streetcar labeled "Seattle Streetcar" travels on tracks parallel to the road. In the background, a yellow city bus with the destination indicator reading "26 Northgate" is visible. A person in high-visibility clothing with a hard hat is walking across the crosswalk, holding a stop sign. Several cars are parked on the right side of the street, and a row of colorful flags is strung overhead. The architecture includes modern buildings with large windows, and more residential structures can be seen in the distance. The sky is overcast, suggesting a typical cloudy day.
