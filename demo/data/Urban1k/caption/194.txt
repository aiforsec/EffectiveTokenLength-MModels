The image depicts a traffic intersection with multiple traffic signals in view. The foreground features a vertical traffic signal showing a green light, with two more unused signal lights above it. An adjacent sign sports a red-bordered triangular yield sign. Also visible are pedestrian crossing lines on the asphalt and a small island for pedestrian safety. In the background, foliage in autumn hues is evident, with trees displaying yellow and green leaves. A mix of residential and commercial buildings with varying architectural designs and colors can be seen. The sky appears overcast, and the street seems void of any traffic or pedestrians at the moment.
