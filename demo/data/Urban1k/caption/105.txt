The image displays an urban environment with pedestrians walking on a sidewalk. The background shows a construction site with fencing, behind which a building with the sign "ESEC" can be seen. Construction materials, such as wooden pallets, are stacked near the fence. Two men and a woman are walking side by side; one man wears a striped shirt and jeans, the other a sleeveless green top and shorts, and the woman a beige tank top and shorts. There is also an individual walking in the foreground wearing a long brown dress and carrying a black bag. The architecture has European features, and the bright sunlight indicates it's daytime.
