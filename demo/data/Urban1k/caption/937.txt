A group of runners is participating in a road race, moving away from the camera perspective toward a distant horizon on an expansive highway. The runners are dressed in various athletic outfits, predominantly in shades of white, black, and bright colors. A mix of genders and ages can be seen. It appears to be a clear, sunny day with a cloudless blue sky. The participants are spread across the full width of the roadway, with traffic signs visible overhead, directing to destinations such as "San Francisco" and "Civic Center." No vehicles are present, indicating the road has been closed for the event.
