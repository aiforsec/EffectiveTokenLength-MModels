This image depicts an urban street scene during daylight with a focus on a brightly colored road sign warning of a school zone. The sign, mounted on a metal pole, features a yellow background with a red-bordered triangle containing the pictogram of an adult and child. Below the triangle, a green-colored word "COLEGIO" is visible. In the background, there's a tree-lined sidewalk with pedestrians, including a person in a red shirt walking towards the camera. Along the street, parked and moving vehicles, including a red car and a motorcycle, are noticeable. Behind, a mix of architectural styles suggests a residential and commercial area.
