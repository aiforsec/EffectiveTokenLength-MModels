The image shows a vintage orange and white Volkswagen Type 2, also known as a VW Bus, parked on a city street. The upper half of the bus is white, while the lower half is orange, with a white stripe separating the two colors. The bus has a number of stickers on its rear window and a roof rack on top carrying what appears to be a gray storage box. Two individuals can be seen inside the vehicle - the driver wearing a red shirt and a passenger next to them. In the background, there's an urban setting with a storefront that reads "SARA'S SCENT PERFUMES," and the side of a larger building with the text "SEYBOLD BUILDING" on the facade. Several pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk, and a palm tree indicates the photo may be taken in a warmer climate.
