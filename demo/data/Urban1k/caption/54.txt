A blue GMC van is parked on an urban street next to a black fire hydrant that is tilted slightly to one side. The van's body shows some wear, including rust at the bottom edges and a few minor dents. There are white stripes along the sides of the van, and the windows appear to be tinted. The front grill is black with the GMC logo in red. The van has a silver front bumper, and the license plate is affixed to it. In the background, there's green foliage, an indistinct red vehicle, and what appears to be the corner of a street intersection.
