This image shows a streetscape with an eclectic mix of objects. On the left is a life-size bronze statue of a man holding a hat at his side, standing on a square base. To the right of the statue is a vibrantly decorated elephant sculpture with a variety of colors and visual motifs, including what appears to be floral designs and faces. The elephant is on a rectangular platform with some greenery. In the background, there's a traditional red telephone booth, and behind that, the view extends down a narrow street lined with buildings and a few pedestrians in the distance. The sky is clear and daylight illuminates the scene.
