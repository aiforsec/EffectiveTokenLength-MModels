A bustling urban street scene with iconic red double-decker London buses, one displaying number 38 to Victoria, in motion on the right. A black van with green graphics is seen on the road to the left. Pedestrians navigate the sidewalks, and amongst them, a person in red is crossing the street. There are various storefronts with signage in the background, and the street is marked with traffic lines and symbols, including bus lane markings. Overhead traffic signals are visible at the center. A bus stop with a shelter and signage is located on the pavement to the right. The sky is overcast.
