In a bustling urban scene, a small, weathered blue three-wheeled vehicle with a pickup-style cargo bed is parked near a pile of scattered debris on the street's edge, facing the left. A poster featuring red and yellow colors adorns a pole in the foreground. Behind the vehicle, a few pedestrians, including two in vivid yellow shirts, traverse a crosswalk, while traditional signage in non-Latin script adorns one building. Cars and taxis, one yellow, share the street further back, under an overcast sky. The environment suggests a location that may be in a Middle Eastern or South Asian city.
