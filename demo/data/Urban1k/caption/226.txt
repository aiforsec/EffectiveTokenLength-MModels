This image showcases a bustling city scene with a focus on public transportation. In the foreground, there's a green and white bus, prominently displaying the number 2102 on its rear. The bus is aligned by the curb next to a sidewalk under a clear blue sky. Alongside it, another similar bus is visible, hinting at a busy transit hub or station. The environment features modern architecture, including a high-rise building with a reflective glass fa√ßade piercing the skyline in the background. Pedestrians are present, suggesting this might be a metropolitan area during a non-peak hour with light foot traffic. The scene is captured from a street-level perspective.
