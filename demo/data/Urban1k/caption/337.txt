Two vintage green buses are parked on an urban street, both exhibiting the destination "Maidstone" with route number "23" clearly visible on the front. The leading bus, number 3402, has a white and black registration plate reading "UKE 402H". Each bus features advertising for "Royal Insurance" along its side in red and blue lettering. Behind the buses, the scene includes a red flag atop a flagpole, a partial view of a tree, and a three-story building with a distinctive sloped roof. Pedestrians are slightly visible in the background, with a hint of parked cars and traffic lights.
