A pedestrian crossing with white zebra stripes spans the forefront while traffic lights loom overhead, the red one prominently displaying a smiley face. On the right, a green-lit sign indicates parking, and an establishment with neon signage is partly visible. The buildings flanking the street showcase classic architecture, their windows dim in the fading light of day.
