Two classic British double-decker buses are parked on a city street with gray pavements and a large, ornate white building in the background. The foremost bus features a unique silver chrome finish with black trim, registration number 650 DYE, and advertisements in varied fonts and sizes. This bus serves Route 9 to Kensington High Street, displaying a destination board that includes "Royal Albert Hall" and "Hyde Park Corner." The second bus, partially visible, exhibits the traditional red color associated with London's iconic Routemaster buses. Both vehicles have two decks of windows and appear well-maintained, indicating either a ceremonial use or preserved service for tourists.
