The image shows a fleet of white Scania semi-trailer trucks parked in a line on a wet concrete yard, with a black car visible to the left. The trucks display logos and text related to bio-ethanol fuel, indicating these are likely used for transporting bio-ethanol ED95. The trucks' cabs are predominantly white, with design accents and brand markings. A brick building is partly visible on the left, while industrial-style metal buildings and structures are in the background. The gray sky suggests overcast weather, and the wet ground indicates recent rain. The trucks are organized neatly, awaiting departure or processing.
