The image depicts a white public transport bus with "METRO" branding on the side, featuring green and blue graphics which include a stylized leaf design. The vehicle is marked with the number 889 and appears to be an older model with a conventional front-engine design. It is parked at a curb on a city street during snowy weather, as evidenced by the accumulation of snow on the ground and on the vehicle itself, particularly around the windshield wipers and the front bumper. Snowflakes are visible in the air against the gray sky, indicating ongoing snowfall.
