Below the display is a black and yellow push button with instructions to wait for the signal. In the background, there's a road with a red car passing by and a white, zebra-striped crosswalk. Buildings with green and grey walls can be seen further away down the street, implying an urban setting. It is daylight, and the environment appears slightly overcast, suggesting possibly cool or temperate weather.
