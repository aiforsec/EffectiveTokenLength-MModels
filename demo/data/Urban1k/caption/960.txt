This image captures an urban street scene on a sunny day. In the foreground is a traffic light pole with a lit green left-turn arrow indicating that it's permissible to turn left. Above the arrow are two unlit signal lights. Attached to the pole is a pedestrian signal displaying a red hand, signaling "Do Not Walk." On the left, part of a beige building with underpass pillars is visible. The middle ground shows vehicles in motion; some appear to be turning left, while others are moving straight. In the background, you can see a tall glass building with multiple stories set against a clear sky. Trees with autumn foliage adorn the right side.
