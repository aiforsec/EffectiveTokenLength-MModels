This image shows a white horse with a harness, hitched to a red, two-wheeled carriage waiting by a curb next to a pedestrian crossing. The horse has a bridle with red accents, and the carriage features decorative elements with a vintage design. There is a signpost next to the horse carrying a warning notice in Spanish. The background captures a city street scene including part of a classical building with columns, pedestrians on the sidewalk, and a glimpse of another person associated with the carriage.
