The image captures an urban scene on a sunny day with a two-story building displaying the street number 147 on its fa√ßade. A white delivery truck covered in graffiti is parked in front of the building. Its prominent graffiti reads "OMG" in large, black letters. There's a red car visible in front of the truck. On the building's ground level, there are storefronts with signage, large windows, and a blue awning. A traffic light showing a yellow signal hangs at the intersection. A pedestrian trash bin and a couple of people are on the sidewalk, with one person seemingly walking across the street in the foreground.
