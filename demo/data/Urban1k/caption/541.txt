This image shows a brick structure with three arches, where people are passing through and around. It appears to be an entrance or gateway. Atop the central arch, there is a significant, square clock face with Roman numerals, set within a metallic frame. Flanking the clock on both sides are sculptures of two animals that resemble bears, situated behind metal bars. The clock and sculptures are supported by a wider ledge featuring ornamental metalwork. There are several pedestrians in view, including a group of adults and a small child standing in the foreground. Leafy trees peek over the top of the structure, suggesting a park-like setting.
