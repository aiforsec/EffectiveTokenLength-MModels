This image captures a rainy urban nighttime scene on a wet street reflecting city lights. Several pedestrians are using umbrellas, with one prominently in the foreground holding a black umbrella. A bus and multiple cars are on the road, with headlights and street lamps contributing to the illumination of the scene. The glare of the lights on the wet surfaces creates a shiny effect on the asphalt. The focus is on a taxi in the middle of the image, painted in a light color, likely yellow, typical of urban taxis. The passengers on the sidewalk appear to be dressed for cool or wet weather.
