This image captures a nighttime city street scene characterized by the ambient glow of artificial illumination. A row of parked cars lines the right side of the road, with their colors ranging from dark hues to silver. The street is canopied by a tunnel of mature trees with interlocking branches, creating a natural archway. The shutter speed of the camera is set to a long exposure, as evidenced by the light trails streaking across the scene, glowing predominantly white with hints of red - a signature of moving vehicles' headlights and taillights. Traffic lights punctuate the distance with splashes of red and yellow, competing with the street lamps that cast a warm light, while the cool tones of the night sky loom overhead.
