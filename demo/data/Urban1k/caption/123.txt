The image depicts a bustling urban scene with a red single-decker bus marked with the number 46 on its route display in the foreground. The bus is on a curving road lined with a mix of classical and modern architecture, featuring stone facades and detailed ornamentation. Leafless trees suggest it might be either late autumn or winter. Pedestrians are visible walking on the sidewalk, while a black car is parked to the side. A street lamp peeks out from the upper right, somewhat contrasting with the historical aesthetic of the buildings. The overcast sky suggests a typical grey day, common in many urban areas.
