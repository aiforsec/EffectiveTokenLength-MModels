The image depicts a city street scene with pedestrians waiting to cross a zebra crossing. A red pedestrian signal indicates not to cross. The crosswalk leads towards a corner building with large windows, behind which statues are visible. There are three people waiting at the crossing: a woman in a beige skirt and black jacket to the left, a woman in the center with a white shirt and patterned skirt, and a man to the right in a light blue shirt with sunglasses and hands on hips. Other individuals are seen in the background, walking on the sidewalk or passing by. The lighting suggests it's a sunny day.
