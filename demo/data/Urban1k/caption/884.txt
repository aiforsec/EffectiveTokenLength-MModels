The image depicts a vibrant urban street scene with vehicles and greenery under a clear sky. In the foreground, a person wearing a high-visibility vest with "POLIZEI" printed on it stands on a raised platform, possibly directing traffic, with outstretched arm. To their right, atop a bustling roadway are cars and a double-decker bus, which has advertisements and reads "M19" as its route number. From the bus livery, we can infer that this may be in Berlin. Traffic signs, including a green light, are visible overhead. Leafy trees line the street, contributing to a mix of nature with the urban environment.
