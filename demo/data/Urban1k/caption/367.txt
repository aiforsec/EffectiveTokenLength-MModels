The image features an urban street scene under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a pink sidewalk is bordered by a red curb, where an orange traffic cone and a black sign advertising event parking for $40 are placed. A person dressed in black, carrying a red bag, walks away in the midground, passing a diamond-shaped orange road sign that signals "Road Construction Ahead". Several palm trees rise along the sidewalk. The background includes a mix of modern buildings with reflective glass facades and scattered vegetation. Various commercial signs and street lights line the road, and cars are visible in the left overlooking the city street.
