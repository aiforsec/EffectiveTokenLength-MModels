A procession of elephants is marching down a city street flanked by handlers dressed in red jackets. The elephants are adorned with red and white decorative coverings and circular logos. In the foreground, a child wearing a red jacket is walking and looking to the side. The background reveals urban buildings with traditional architectural features, street signs, traffic lights, parked cars, and a clear sky. The scene is busy but orderly, with spectators implied by the presence of controlled movement and vehicles. The atmosphere suggests a public event, possibly a parade, where the elephants are featured attractions.
