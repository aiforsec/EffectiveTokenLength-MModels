This is an image of a modern red double-decker bus, specifically labeled route 38, on a city street. The front of the bus is angled towards the camera, showing its distinctive curved design and large glass windscreen. The bus has a black trim around the base and wheel arches, and it features the typical London transport logo. Pedestrians are on the pavement to the left, with one person stepping onto the bus. Behind the double-decker, another red bus is visible. A red hatchback car drives by on the road, and behind it is a stone building with arched windows and a flagpole on its roof. The sky is partly cloudy.
