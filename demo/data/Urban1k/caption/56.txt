The image portrays an urban street scene with a prominent terracotta-colored building labeled "HOTEL HESPERIA FINISTERRE" forming an archway over the street. The building has multiple windows, and there's a crest-like decoration above the arch. A zebra crossing is in the foreground with pedestrians walking across it. To the left, an elderly woman walks by the street, and a black sign with white lettering is partially visible. There are cars parked on both sides of the street, and a few people are seen walking and conversing near a small statue located in a center island. The sky is overcast, suggesting cloudy weather.
