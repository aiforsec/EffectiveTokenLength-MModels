This image depicts a white bus parked on a street beside a sidewalk, partially obstructed by a lens flare caused by the sunlight. The bus has visible writing and the number 3804 on its side. Next to the bus, there's a gray sedan with its front facing the viewer. In the background, buildings with various storefronts and signage can be seen, and there appears to be a sale banner hanging on one of them. The sky is clear, suggesting fair weather. The angle and reflection suggest the photo was taken from inside a vehicleâ€”the right side of a car is in the foreground on the right edge of the image.
