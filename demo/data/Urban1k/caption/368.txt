The image depicts a white and green public city bus marked as "Ipswich Buses," coming out from under a railway bridge that has a green metal structure with hazard-warning black and yellow stripes at the edges. The bus is on an asphalt road and displays a route sign indicating "Ipswich Central 13 via Rail Station." A triangular road sign with a black height restriction symbol (12'-3") is visible atop the bridge, along with a metal fence lining the top of the brick bridge walls. Some vegetation is visible behind the fence, and the environment appears overcast, suggesting an urban setting on a cloudy day.
