This image captures a busy urban night scene, possibly in New York City, going by the "NY" on the side of the bus which is central to the composition. The bus is marked "M20 via 7 AV" and has "Congestion Free" written below the window. There's a street vendor standing next to his cart, which appears to be selling snacks. Behind him is an illuminated billboard, and the starry night sky can just be made out above the high-rise buildings. The area is bustling with pedestrians and vehicles, including taxis, and there are traffic lights and signs that add to the busy atmosphere of the scene.
