The image depicts an urban roadway underneath an overpass on a sunny day. There is a black car in the foreground waiting at a traffic light, which is displaying a red signal. The road is marked with a right-turn arrow on the asphalt, indicating a turn lane. Above, a directional sign with a white arrow on a black background points to the right. A blue highway sign shows the number 8 with an arrow pointing left for WEST alongside a wheelchair-accessible symbol. The infrastructure of the overpass features concrete columns and beams, and a glimpse of the city skyline is partly visible in the background. Aerial wires cross above, and there is a hanging orange construction sign on the left side.
