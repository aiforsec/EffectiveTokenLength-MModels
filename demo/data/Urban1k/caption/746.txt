This image captures a sunny day on a lively urban street lined with red-brick buildings of various heights, typical of European architecture. In the foreground is a designated green bike lane with a cyclist riding towards the camera. Pedestrians cross the road, some in the distance wait to cross, and others walk along the sidewalk. On the right, there's a storefront with a green awning, likely a restaurant, with outdoor yellow-shaded seating visible. A classic blue car is driving through the intersection, and the traffic signals are visible with red lights indicating a stop for vehicles on the closest side.
