The image depicts a classic British railway scene featuring a red, white and grey diesel locomotive at a station. The locomotive is on the right side of the photograph, approaching the camera, with its front lights on and sporting a distinctly British Rail design from the latter part of the 20th century. The platform extends to the left, devoid of people, and is lined with various signs including one that appears to indicate a speed limit for trains. The rails recede into the distance towards a vanishing point. The weather is overcast, and there's a small building with a brown exterior in the background to the right.
