In the bustling urban setting, a city bus with 'M5 South Ferry' designation is centered on a crosswalk, exhibiting a predominantly white color with blue and red stripes and advertisement decals. It travels along a street lined with multi-story buildings displaying various commercial signs. Pedestrians gather at the corners waiting to cross, one is visible in motion crossing the street. Bare trees suggest cooler weather, and the cloudy sky indicates overcast conditions. The architecture displays a blend of historic and contemporary styles, with the presence of scaffolding hinting at construction or renovation work. The foreground light pole hosts a collection of stickers and graffiti.
