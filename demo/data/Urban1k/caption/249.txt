This image depicts an overcast day on an urban street lined with tall, modern office buildings. A blue public bus marked with the number 421 is at the forefront on the road, while a red bus can be seen farther down the street. There is a white car on the left and traffic lights are visible overhead, with a red light illuminated. The road has multiple lanes and a pedestrian zebra crossing in the foreground. There's also a traffic sign indicating no left turn for motorcycles. Leafless trees suggest it may be winter or early spring. The overall scene appears to be calm with moderate traffic.
