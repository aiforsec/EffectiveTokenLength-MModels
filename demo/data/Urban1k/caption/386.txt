This image captures a busy urban street scene in daylight. A blue city bus with extended accordion-like middle section navigates a right turn, its overhead electric lines connected to the street's wiring. Pedestrians are dispersed throughout the scene, some crossing the street, others walking along the sidewalk, adhering to a crosswalk. The architecture of the surrounding buildings is typical of a downtown city, with large glass windows and ornate detailing. The corner building features prominent banners, and pedestrian traffic signals are visible. The sunlight creates harsh shadows on the pavement and buildings, suggesting the sun is high in the sky.
