This image shows a two-story house with a gray exterior and darker gray trim around the windows and roofline. In front of the house is a black wrought-iron fence, and a row of trash cans is aligned on the curb. A utility pole stands prominently to the right, with multiple power lines running across the top of the frame. A person in a pink top sits on a public bench just behind the sidewalk, and an orange bus is visible to the right, indicating a suburban setting with public transportation. The background reveals a hilly landscape with green foliage and additional houses scattered on the hillside under a clear blue sky.
