The image shows a busy urban street scene with a focus on a row of parked bicycles in the foreground, displaying a variety of colors like red, blue, and silver, and designs. Behind the bicycles, in the mid-ground, there is a yellow and red tram marked with the number 11, indicating public transportation. The tram is on tracks laid on the road surface, and a man is seen next to it, appearing to be boarding or alighting. On the opposite side of the street is a row of buildings with European architectural styles. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cloudy day.
