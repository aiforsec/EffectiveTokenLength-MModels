A pair of dark horses harnessed to a carriage stand on a sunlit street lined with colorful buildings under a clear blue sky. The horses, adorned with shiny leather tack and bridles, appear at rest. In the background, people stroll along the sidewalk, some in pairs, alongside quaint shops and eateries with bright facades ranging from green to white. A pedestrian crossing is visible on the street. To the right, a person walks a dog, and lush greenery can be spotted on the upper edges of the frame, indicating a well-maintained urban environment. The scene is peaceful, conveying a sense of leisure in a picturesque town setting.
