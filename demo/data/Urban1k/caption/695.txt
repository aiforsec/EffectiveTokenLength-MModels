The image shows an urban street scene featuring a double-decker bus with the number 44 on its display, operated by First, parked or in slow traffic on the left. The bus is predominantly white with pink and blue accents, and its registration plate reads 'WX09 KBV.' A dark red car is parked in the foreground with the license plate 'K5 PLJ.' To the right, there's a stone-faced building with a faded advertisement for 'Shell' painted on its side. On the ground floor, thereâ€™s a commercial space with blue signage for 'Martin & Co' estate agents, and a 'To Let' sign above suggesting availability. Additional street signs and a pedestrian crossing indicator are visible.
