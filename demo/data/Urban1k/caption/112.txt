In the foreground, a person wearing a black jacket, gloves, and jeans rides a black motorcycle with chrome details, leading a group of motorcyclists. The rider's helmet has a star-spangled design reminiscent of the American flag. They navigate a city road, marked with white lines and patches of repair. Behind them, another motorcyclist donning a black jacket follows closely. The street is bustling with activity, featuring pedestrians in casual attire crossing further back, a purple city bus, and various cars, including a red vehicle farther down the road. The scene unfolds under a clear sky with buildings hinting at an urban setting.
