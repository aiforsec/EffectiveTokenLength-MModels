This image captures a city scene in bright daylight with a clear blue sky. In the foreground, there are traffic signals on poles with one displaying a green light for cyclists. A pedestrian is crossing the street, walking on the zebra crossing, with moving vehicles—a silver car and a grey car—visible in the vicinity. To the left, a red traffic light for vehicles is seen. On the right, another traffic light shows a red man, indicating a stop for pedestrians. Behind this urban activity is a grand, classical building with ornate architectural details and sculptures, partially obscured by the street signs and lamps. It appears to be an important historical or public structure.
