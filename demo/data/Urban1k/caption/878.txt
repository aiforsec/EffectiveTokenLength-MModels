The image depicts an urban street scene with a mix of signage and traffic. In the foreground, there is a lamppost with multiple signs attached: a blue parking (P) sign with a white arrow, and below it, a white sign with black lettering indicating "POLLING STATION" also with a white arrow directing to the right. A hanging flower basket with a variety of flowers, predominately yellow, is suspended from the lamppost. The background features a red, double-decker bus with noticeable text and bus route number, partially occluded by the foliage of a tree. Parked cars line the street, with a backdrop of traditional white townhouses casting shadows on the sunny day.
