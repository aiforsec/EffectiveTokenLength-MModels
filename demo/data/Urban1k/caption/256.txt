The image captures a sunny day on an urban roadway with a green and white trolleybus prominently in the foreground, bearing the route number 23. The asphalt road stretches ahead, flanked on the right by green foliage and a pedestrian sidewalk where a person is seen from the back, wearing a red jacket and dark pants, walking next to a bicycle. Street lamps line the sidewalk at consistent intervals. A variety of cars can be seen in the distance, traveling in the same direction as the trolleybus. Behind a row of trees to the right, a building with a red facade is partially visible. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting a fair weather day.
