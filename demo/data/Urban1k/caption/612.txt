This image captures a sunny day on an urban street corner with clear blue skies. Several two- and three-story buildings line the block, sporting a mix of white, beige, and brick red facades. The corner building features a flat, white exterior. On the sidewalks, a few pedestrians are visible, including one walking across a pedestrian crossing. A bright yellow school bus is in motion on the road, and a stationary white vehicle is partly seen in the foreground. Numerous power lines crisscross above the scene, and overhead, various traffic and street signs are mounted, including a "No Standing Anytime" sign.
