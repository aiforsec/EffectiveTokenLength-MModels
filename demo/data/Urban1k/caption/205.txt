A traditional yellow American school bus is in motion on an urban street, identifiable by the "SCHOOL BUS" sign on the front and side. It features red flashing lights on top and an extended stop sign on the left side. The bus number 2508 is visible on the hood and side. Urban trees without leaves suggest it might be late autumn or winter. A red traffic signal is shown in the background, above the bus. The street appears wet, possibly from a recent rain, and a red car is stopped in the background, with high-rise buildings looming under an overcast sky.
