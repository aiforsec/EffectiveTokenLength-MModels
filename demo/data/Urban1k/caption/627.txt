This image captures a vibrant green electric locomotive with the label "Green Cargo" pulling a series of brown freight cars over a steel girder bridge. The locomotive is adorned with yellow and red details near the front and the sides, as well as the number "1243." Overhead lines provide power to the train through pantographs extended from the roof of the engine. The setting is urban, with multiple buildings of varying styles in the background under a mostly blue sky with a few scattered clouds. To the left, on the bridge's pedestrian walkway, stands a person observing the train, while street lamps and power masts line the bridge. Car traffic is visible parallel to the tracks on the right.
