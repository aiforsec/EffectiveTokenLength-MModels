This is an image of a modern articulated bus in motion on a city street during daylight with clear skies. The bus has a two-tone color scheme, primarily silver with green accents near the bottom. It has the route number and possibly a destination shown on the front. Pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk in the background, along with a cyclist. The urban setting features contemporary buildings with glass facades, traffic lights, and a well-maintained asphalt road. The sunshine casts sharp shadows on the ground, indicating either morning or late afternoon light. The bus is equipped with side mirrors, windscreen wipers, and appears to have a digital panel above the windshield for route information.
