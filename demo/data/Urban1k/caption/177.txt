The image captures a bustling city street scene featuring an iconic San Francisco cable car, numbered 4, with its distinguishing dark wood exterior and open-sided passenger areas. Passengers stand holding onto poles, and a few are getting on or off the cable car. They are wearing casual attire, indicative of comfortable, leisurely travel. The cable car is on tracks and the road looks busy, flanked by lined cars and overshadowed by multi-story commercial buildings. The people waiting on the street are also casually dressed, and one person is carrying shopping bags, suggesting nearby retail activity. The sky is clear suggesting good weather.
