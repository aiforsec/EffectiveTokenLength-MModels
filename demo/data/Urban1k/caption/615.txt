A police officer stands beside a black and white scooter on an urban street, which is lined with parked cars of various colors including red, silver, and black. The officer wears a light blue shirt, dark trousers, and a white helmet with a reflective visor. Behind him, there is a yellow delivery van parked on the sidewalk next to a shop with a red sign that reads "FOTO." Other signs visible include one that advertises "Estudio Foto," and others that are partly obscured. The background is bustling with commercial activity, and the sky is blue, indicating a clear day.
