A blue and white articulated sightseeing bus travels along a city street with leafless trees and a cloudy sky in the background. The bus, with a classic design, features red and blue striping along its sides. Cars in varying colors wait at the traffic light, with a green sedan directly behind the bus. On the left, a construction site has a tall crane towering over the partially visible buildings. Near the center, a traffic signal shows a green light. On the right, parked cars line the curb adjacent to a sidewalk, including a black SUV and a red car. The overall setting suggests an overcast day in an urban space.
