This image captures an urban street scene during daylight. On the left, there's a white-barked tree with sparse foliage beside a black street lamp. In the foreground, a sign attached to a pole is partially visible. The middle of the image shows a wide street with multiple lanes and a green car driving. Traffic lights are stationed at an intersection, and a few pedestrians are standing and walking around. The background features an array of buildings with classic architectural styles. There's also a large billboard attached to a building bearing the slogan "NEVER HIDE" with a monochromatic image of a person. The sky is partially cloudy, hinting at fair weather.
