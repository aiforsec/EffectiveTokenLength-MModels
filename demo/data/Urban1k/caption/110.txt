A white delivery truck with green and white branding for 'Retrograde Ltd.' is parked on a city street beside a pedestrian sidewalk. On its side, the truck features the slogan 'Rewarding recycling' and a row of colorful recycling symbols indicating different materials. Small text provides contact information. A single palm tree is visible on the left side of the frame, and a blue sky with clouds looms overhead. The street is lined with two-story buildings housing various businesses, including a pharmacy with blue signage across the street, and a sign for Samaritans is partially visible.
