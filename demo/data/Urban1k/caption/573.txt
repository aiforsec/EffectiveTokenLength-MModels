This image captures a city street during a snowfall. Bare winter trees line the left side of the street, their branches heavy with the accumulating snow. A dark red sedan drives in the foreground, tail lights glowing, while a colorful public transit bus follows behind. There's a mix of vehicles moving along the wet road, all with their headlights on due to the overcast, snowy weather. Street lamps are lit, and a no-left-turn traffic sign is visible to the right. On the sidewalks, piles of shoveled snow indicate the pedestrian areas. Buildings in the background appear hazy and muted through the falling snow.
