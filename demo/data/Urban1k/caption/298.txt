The image depicts a yellow amphibious tour bus floating on a body of water, likely a river, in an urban setting. The bus is partially submerged, with its wheels visible below the waterline, indicating that it is designed for both land and water travel. The riverbank is lined with rocks and behind it, there are multiple buildings with uniform architecture, suggesting a residential area. Further in the background, there is a dock with several boats and a white building with large windows. Above, the sky is clear blue, indicating fair weather conditions. The photograph is taken during daylight, with good visibility.
