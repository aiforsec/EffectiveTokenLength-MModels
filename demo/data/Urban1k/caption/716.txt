The image captures a bustling street scene with a blue and white minibus parked on the left, in front of a building with a sign reading "MERVE." A donkey, harnessed to a two-wheeled cart loaded with goods, is in the center, guided by a person. On the right, there is a vintage blue car driving, with its rear visible and a license plate that is partly obscured. The environment suggests a temperate climate with evergreen trees and casual-dressed pedestrians in the background. The vehicles and attire suggest the photo could be from a region where older modes of transportation are still in use. The roundabout features manicured bushes and flowers.
