This is a night-time urban scene showing a street flanked by buildings with illuminated signage. In the foreground, on the left, there is a pedestrian crossing sign signifying a crosswalk ahead. Above the street, a decorative light display reads "Welcome to Sunnyside," suggesting this is an entrance to a neighborhood named Sunnyside. The street is lined with parked cars on the left and has moving traffic that appears as streaks of light due to long exposure. The warm glow from streetlights and various business signs offers a contrasting ambiance to the dusky blue sky above.
