This image features a large blue transport truck from "Abbey Transport Ltd." carrying an oversized white yacht wrapped in protective covering on an urban road. The yacht extends significantly beyond the length of the trailer, suggesting it's quite large. The cab of the truck is marked with "Yacht & Machinery Transport" and the sign "ABNORMAL LOAD," indicating the special nature of the cargo. The trailer appears to have multiple wheel axles to distribute the weight of the yacht. The truck is on the right side of the road, hinting at a location with left-hand traffic. The surroundings include a red bus in the background, buildings, and a pedestrian on the left edge.
