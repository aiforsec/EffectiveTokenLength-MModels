A blue traffic sign with white text and symbols is mounted on a metal pole, prominently displaying the message "Four Waiting Lanes Ahead" alongside directional arrows indicating lane divisions. Below the sign is a red banner with yellow and white text and a graphic depicting a map of China. People walk on a shaded sidewalk beneath, with one man in a brown shirt and shorts notably closer to the camera. In the background, busy traffic is visible, including a yellow taxi, other various colored cars, and urban high-rise buildings under a cloudy sky. A 'no parking' sign is also seen attached to a lamp post.
