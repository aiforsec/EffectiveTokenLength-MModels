The image depicts a wet urban street scene on an overcast day. In the foreground, a dedicated bicycle lane with a street marking of a bicycle and an arrow points in the direction of travel. To the left, there's a street corner with a yellow tactile paving slab for visually impaired pedestrians and a green and white traffic sign indicating a left turn with a bicycle and an arrow. Mounted above on the same pole is a traffic signal with a red left arrow. On the sidewalk, a vintage-style, red and white drive-in restaurant sign promotes hamburgers and claims to offer "instant service." Further down the street, cars and traffic lights extend into the cloudy background.
