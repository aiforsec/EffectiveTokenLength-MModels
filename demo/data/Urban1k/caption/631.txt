A double-decker bus painted in blue and yellow is stopped across tram tracks in an urban setting with its front end facing towards the right of the image. The bus appears to have been involved in a mishap, with emergency services at the scene, represented by an individual in a high-vis vest standing near the bus with a red box and some equipment on the ground. Two pedestrians are walking by in the foreground, appearing largely unconcerned. Overhead, tram wires crisscross against a cloudy sky, and there's a traffic sign prohibiting turns attached to a lamppost.
