This image captures a city street scene on a sunny day. In the foreground, a silver car is stopped at a pedestrian crossing, marked with white zebra stripes, on an asphalt road. The traffic signal for the vehicle is red, as indicated by the traffic lights visible on the right. The street is lined with trees and multistory buildings with retail businesses on the ground floor, and there are blue street signs hanging from a post on the right. Pedestrians can be seen in the distance, and there is another car, a yellow taxi, visible on the left side of the photo.
