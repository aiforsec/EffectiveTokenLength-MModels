The image shows a daytime setting with a clear sky and a bright yellow car parked in the foreground. Behind the car is a large sign for "Smitty's Market, Inc.," framed by a red border, featuring a red depiction of a cow and lettering advertising barbecue, hot sausage, and fresh choice meat. To the left, a brown directional sign with white lettering points to "DR EUGENE CLARK LIBRARY." In the background, a Valero gas station and other vehicles are visible, suggesting a commercial area. A red fire hydrant stands to the right of the frame, and there are traffic control devices at the roadside.
