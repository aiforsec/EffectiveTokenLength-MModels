This image shows an urban landscape filled with high-rise buildings under a clear blue sky. In the center stands a distinctly taller skyscraper with a curved facade and a series of balconies; its glass windows reflect the sunlight. To its left, there's a modern building with a beige and white exterior, while to the right, there's a building featuring a mix of cream and glass elements. In the foreground, a classical style building with a green dome and a clock is noticeable, juxtaposing old architectural design with the new. Street lamps and a small tree are also visible, adding some urban greenery to the scene. The overall tone of the photo is warm, likely from the sunlight or a filter.
