This image captures a busy urban street lined with parked vehicles on the right side, predominantly in shades of black and gray. A row of red-brick buildings with fire escape ladders adorns the background, hinting at a dense city neighborhood. Multiple street signs mounted on a single pole are clustered together, including regulatory parking signs and a blue parking meter instruction sign. The meter itself stands out with a bright blue label and graffiti marks. Leafless trees suggest it might be autumn or winter, and a distant traffic signal displays a green light. The clear daytime setting indicates regular city life and order.
