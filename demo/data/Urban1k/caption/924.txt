An elderly couple walks their small dog on a city sidewalk in front of a closed commercial establishment with metal shutters down. The building façade is made of stone, with ornate architectural details and balconies featuring intricate iron railings. Three flags are displayed above the entrance: a Catalan flag, an EU flag, and an American flag. The shop fronts have signage for “TOUS.” The street appears calm with a car and a motorcycle parked in the background. The color palette includes various shades of grey from the building and pavement, muted tones from the walking couple’s attire, and vibrant hues from the flags.
