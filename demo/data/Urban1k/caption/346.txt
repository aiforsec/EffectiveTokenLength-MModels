The signs, in hues of red, green, yellow, and blue, advertise various businesses including restaurants and a 7-Eleven convenience store. Some signs are bilingual in English and Chinese, offering services like "Authentic Indian & Nepalese Food" and "EAT-IN OR TAKE AWAY." Buildings with multiple stories show facades with air conditioning units, windows, and banners.
