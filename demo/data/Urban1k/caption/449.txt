In the image, we see an articulated white and green city bus with its poles connected to overhead electric lines, suggesting it is a trolleybus. License plates and fleet numbers are visible on the vehicle. It is daylight with a mix of clouds and blue sky above. The environment appears urban, as there are buildings in the background, pedestrian sidewalks, traffic lights, and street lamps. A red banner hangs from one of the street lamps, and there's a tree starting to show leaves on the right, indicating spring or summer. There is additional traffic on the road, including a yellow van and signs of other vehicles.
