This image captures a bustling evening scene at a city transportation hub. A large, illuminated clock tower stands as the focal point, with a glowing clock face visible. Neoclassical architecture characterizes the building, featuring arched windows, a series of columns, and decorative lighting. Palm trees line the background, slightly blurred by the dimming light. In the foreground, a yellow bus in motion is captured, with light trails hinting at its speed. Overhead, a network of trolleybus wires crisscrosses the sky, dotted with ambient lighting from the surrounding infrastructure. The streets are wet, reflecting nearby lights and creating a slick surface.
