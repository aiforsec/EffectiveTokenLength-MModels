The image displays a vibrant red double-decker bus on a street, signposted as serving various stops including Stratford. The bus has colorful graphics and advertisements on it, and the upper deck is open-top, suggesting it might be used for sightseeing. In the foreground, a pedestrian crossing is visible along with a red pedestrian signal, indicating that it's not safe to cross. To the sides of the bus, there are street lamps and a mix of residential and perhaps commercial buildings with sloped roofs. A passerby is captured in motion, wearing a dark jacket, while a parked silver car is partially visible. The overcast sky suggests a cloudy day.
