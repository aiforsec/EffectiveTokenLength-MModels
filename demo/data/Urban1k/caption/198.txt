This image features a red and white city bus marked with the number 37 and the destination "ZONA FRANCA - HOSP.CLINIC" on its front digital display panel. The bus, with its side displaying a few advertisements, is stopped on a street with various other vehicles alongside it, including a dark-colored car directly next to the bus. The street scene shows a sunny day with blue skies and some clouds, and there are buildings with European-style architecture in the background. The locale appears to be an urban setting with pedestrians and street furniture like a bench and a lamp post visible on the sidewalk.
