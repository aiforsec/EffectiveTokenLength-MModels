This image shows an urban construction scene under an overcast sky. In the foreground, orange traffic cones line the side of a tarmac road, alongside which a yellow construction truck is parked. Behind it, construction machinery, including a yellow excavator, operates in a cordoned-off area with various construction materials scattered around. A green streetlamp stands to the left, and behind the construction site, a modern multi-story building with dark windows and exterior panels looms. The environment suggests redevelopment in a city area, and multiple vehicles indicate active work. Overhead, tram or power cables crisscross the grey sky.
