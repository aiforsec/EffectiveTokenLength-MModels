This image captures a bustling scene outside the Quincy Market in Boston, with a crowd of people congregating in the vicinity. The foreground features various individuals who appear to be tourists and locals, walking or standing, engaged in conversation or enjoying the area. The market's fa√ßade is a classical architectural structure with a prominent entrance featuring pillars and a pediment. Above the entrance, the golden signage spells "QUINCY MARKET," and a banner below announces an event. In the background, there's a glimpse of a tall clock tower and other historic buildings surrounding the market, suggesting an urban downtown atmosphere. The overcast sky suggests it could be either late spring, summer, or early fall.
