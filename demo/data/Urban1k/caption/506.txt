This image depicts an urban street scene showing several pedestrians, with one walking away from the camera and another facing towards a public telephone booth. The street is lined with buildings of various styles, including a brick one on the right and a more modern, paneled building on the left. There is a series of black bollards on the pavement and some pigeons on the ground. Two no-entry signs are prominently displayed on poles in the middle of the image. Overhanging leafless tree branches suggest it might be late autumn or winter. In the background, a man and a woman are engaged in conversation next to a parked white van.
