This image captures a busy urban street scene with pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. A large clock projects from the second storey of a brick building, prominently displaying the time. The architecture reveals a blend of what appears to be Victorian-era buildings with modern signage. There are multiple shops at street level, including a key-cutting and shoe repair service named Timpson, and another store called Robertson & Watt. Pedestrians are dressed in a variety of outfits, from casual to business attire, suggesting a diverse mix of purposes and destinations. The lighting suggests late afternoon, with the sun casting shadows on the buildings.
