This image shows a sunny, tree-lined city street with dappled shadows on the pavement. Two motorbikes are parked on the sidewalk in the foreground: one is directly facing the viewer, and the other is behind it, perpendicular to the street. The sidewalk appears to be designated for parking, with dashed lines and a 'P' sign. Commercial signs and storefronts line the far side of the street, along with parked cars and moving vehicles, including a white car and a dark sedan. There's a person walking in the distance on the opposite sidewalk, and red traffic barriers can be seen further down the street.
