The image features a bustling street scene with a prominent yellow and blue trolleybus in the forefront, bearing the number 6083. The trolleybus is connected overhead to electric wires, indicative of its mode of power. Surrounding the trolley are numerous vehicles, predominantly taxis, which are easily identifiable by their yellow color and lighted signs on the roofs. In the background, there's lush green foliage, power lines crisscrossing the sky, and modern buildings, with one displaying the sign 'AMALIA'. The sky is bright and clear, suggesting a sunny day. Reflections can be seen in the windows of the trolleybus and the cars, adding to the dynamic urban environment.
