A fleet of cream-colored Mercedes taxis with "TAXI" signs on top forms a queue on a paved surface, possibly a taxi stand. Most vehicles feature an identical make and model, lined up in two uneven rows, with orange traffic cones placed intermittently to guide the lineup. Several drivers and passengers are visible standing beside the cars, engaged in conversations or activities such as reading a paper. The background shows a building with glass walls at the entrance and a person wearing reflective safety gear, suggesting a controlled and organized taxi dispatch area, potentially part of an airport or transport hub. The weather appears to be sunny and clear.
