This image shows an overcast urban scene with a light rail vehicle crossing an intersection. The train is white with green accents and advertising on its side. In the foreground, we see a level crossing with barrier arms lowered, indicating that vehicles must stop for the passing train. Overhead, there is a traffic signal gantry with red lights illuminated and pedestrian signals indicating not to cross. Buildings on either side of the street have signage; notably, one has 'noodles & company' written in lower-case letters. The architecture of the buildings suggests a mix of commercial and possibly residential use, typical of an urban environment.
