The image shows a street scene with a red double-decker bus in the right half of the frame, labeled for Santander Central Hospital, indicating it might be in a city in Spain. There's a blue hatchback car parked on the side of the road in the foreground. To the left, we see storefronts with one named 'EVA'. The architecture above the shops includes balconies with green plants. There's also a pedestrian partially visible near the 'EVA' shop. The road markings suggest there's possibly a bus or bike lane, and the overall scene appears to be in an urban European setting.
