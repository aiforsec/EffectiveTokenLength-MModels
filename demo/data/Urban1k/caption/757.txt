An urban street scene with overcast skies. Pedestrians cross a zebra-striped crosswalk. A man in a blue jacket and red beanie walks in the foreground. An orange-yellow traffic light, displaying a walking pedestrian symbol, hangs at the intersection. Classic European-style buildings with ornate facades line the street, creating a corridor effect. A public bus and cars are visible on the road, and the bus has a blue and white color scheme. Streetlights and traffic signals are mounted on poles at the corners. The overall mood is busy yet orderly, with a cool color palette emphasizing the city's architecture and bustling vibe.
